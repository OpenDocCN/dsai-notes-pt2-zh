- en: This study introduces a novel approach to simulating legislative processes using
    LLM-driven virtual agents, focusing on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee.
    We developed agents representing individual senators and placed them in simulated
    committee discussions. The agents demonstrated the ability to engage in realistic
    debate, provide thoughtful reflections, and find bipartisan solutions under certain
    conditions. Notably, the simulation also showed promise in modeling shifts towards
    bipartisanship in response to external perturbations. Our results indicate that
    this LLM-driven approach could become a valuable tool for understanding and potentially
    improving legislative processes, supporting a broader pattern of findings highlighting
    how LLM-based agents can usefully model real-world phenomena. Future works will
    focus on enhancing agent complexity, expanding the simulation scope, and exploring
    applications in policy testing and negotiation.

    capable of memorization, reasoning, and reflection, using natural language as
    a medium of input and output. The advent of LLMs – particularly GPT models trained
    on diverse datasets generated by processing internet content [1] – have generated
    particular interest in the development of virtual agents. These agents aim to
    adopt distinct personas according to user design, interacting with other agents
    and potential actions in sandbox environments to form simulations of scenarios.
    Such models have reasonably simulated diverse settings, such as hospital management
    [2], virtual reality games [3], and computer programming [4]. The importance of
    developing such simulations lies in valuable direct task outputs (ex: automated
    code generation), as well as the creation of perturbable environments which can
    be used to better study modeled systems (ex: discovering optimal patient care
    strategies in hospitals).'

    individuals working to achieve their own agendas. The goal of the U.S. Senate
    is to propose, debate, and pass legislation that benefits the senators’ constituents.
    The Senate often faces political gridlock and polarization, where neither side
    is willing to compromise. Efforts to research and better understand political
    polarization have primarily drawn on social science, including the development
    of quantitative indicators of political dysfunction as well as takeaways from
    real-world experience [5] [6].

    present the first attempt to use LLM-driven virtual agents to simulate the US
    Senate, focusing on the Select Committee on Intelligence as a proof-of-concept.
    We seek to demonstrate the potential to use such a system for exploration of legislative
    behavior and discovery of useful themes, such as how to promote bipartisanship
    in a gridlocked body.

    Specifically, we defined agents with specific attributes relevant to their roles
    as US Senators (name, supported policies, key traits, years of service). Next,
    we placed them into debate with each other on various complex issues. Each agent
    was assigned a memory stream which they could refer back throughout debate, to
    inform discussions with context of previous interactions. At the end of each discussion
    segment, we could ask the agents to reflect on specific ideas, at which time they
    accessed the same memory stream to generate relevant summaries.

    Intelligence. To provide accurate information about each Senator to their representative
    agent, we accessed the popular GPT-3.5 LLM model [8] using the OpenAI API to generate
    concise policies and key traits about each member of the committee. For instance,
    for Republican Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, the LLM generated the following
    policy bio: "My policies are aimed at advancing economic growth and strengthening
    America’s role in the world".'

    debate, the agents accessed their memories to make more informed comments in the

- en: Here, we demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven virtual agents to simulate
    complex legislative processes in the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee. The ability
    of the agents to provide accurate summarizations and thoughtful reflections suggests
    that our model can capture nuanced decision-making processes. Expert-assigned
    believability indicates that outputs from our system are reasonably reflective
    of real-world Senate proceedings, highlighting the applicability of the framework.
    The capacity of the simulation to model bipartisanship, especially in response
    to external perturbations, is significant. This suggests our model could be valuable
    for studying factors that promote bipartisanship in legislative bodies. Broadly,
    our findings showcase the utility of using LLM-based virtual agents to improve
    human understanding of critical real-world scenarios.

    tools for enhancing policymaking by helping refine and target legislation [9].
    Recently, Moghimifar et al [10] utilized LLMs to model consensus-finding negotiations
    between political coalitions. However, their methodology did not adapt agent models
    equipped with memory capability, and their simulation structure utilized Markov
    Models rather than open-ended discussion between agents. We believe that the application
    of these differences enable our approach to more flexibly model government actions
    at the granular individual actor level.

    due to computational resource constraints associated with LLM usage. Additionally,
    we present a preliminary analysis of the proposed methods, where systemic evaluations
    of adherence to real-world outcomes or comparison of factors driving bipartisanship,
    were out of scope. Future works can increase agent complexity, expanding the simulation
    to include the full Congress, and train agents on historical data to simulate
    past legislative sessions. The proposed framework could further be used to simulate
    outcomes of legislation, helping policymakers anticipate challenges and proactively
    identify grounds for bipartisanship.

    in response to external factors is particularly noteworthy. As we refine and expand
    this model, we anticipate it will become a valuable tool for political scientists,
    policymakers, and educators. By establishing a flexible, controllable environment
    for studying legislative dynamics, this approach opens up new avenues for research
    in political science and governance.
