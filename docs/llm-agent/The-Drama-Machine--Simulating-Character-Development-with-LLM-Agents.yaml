- en: This paper explores use of multiple large language model (LLM) agents to simulate
    complex, dynamic characters in dramatic scenarios. We introduce a ‘drama machine’
    framework that coordinates interactions between LLM agents playing different ‘Ego’
    and ‘Superego’ psychological roles. In roleplay simulations, this design allows
    inter-subjective dialogue and intra-subjective internal monologue to develop in
    parallel. We apply this framework to two dramatic scenarios - an interview and
    a detective story - and compare character development with and without the Superego’s
    influence. Though exploratory, results suggest this multi-agent approach can produce
    more nuanced, adaptive narratives that evolve over a sequence of dialogical turns.
    We discuss different modalities of LLM-based roleplay and character development,
    along with what this might mean for conceptualization of AI subjectivity. The
    paper concludes by considering how this approach opens possibilities for thinking
    of the roles of internal conflict and social performativity in AI-based simulation.

    the presentation of a ‘subjectivity’ with interior thought and life. Key to this
    conjuring are the supple and often coherent speech acts performed by LLMs, sustained
    over long dialogical exchanges by sheer computational scale. As one measure of
    this scale, each published version of OpenAI’s GPT (Generalised Pre-trained) model
    (Vaswani et al., [2017](#bib.bib57)) has increased in size by one to two orders
    of magnitude (Radford et al., [2018](#bib.bib45), [2019](#bib.bib46); Brown et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib7); Benesty, [2023](#bib.bib6)). Less noticed but no less important
    have been the complementary techniques that direct models into desired patterns
    of simulated ‘human’ response: Reinforcement Learning via Human Feedback (RLHF)
    (see Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib41)); formalisation of dialogical roles (‘system’,
    ‘user’ and ‘assistant’) for LLM inputs/outputs in chatbot implementations; and
    a wide family of prompt engineering strategies, executed via those roles (Sahoo
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib47)). Re-training or exploiting the model, these devices
    organise the ‘presentation’ of an automated subject to syncopate with the rhythms

    Millar, [2021](#bib.bib35)). But the novel expressivity of LLMs has occasioned
    renewed interest (Magee et al., [2023](#bib.bib33); Heimann and Hübener, [2023](#bib.bib26);
    Žižek, [2023](#bib.bib69)). Magee et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)) have for example
    proposed an analogy between the structure of instruction-based chat-oriented models
    (such as ChatGPT) and Freud’s topology of the subject (ego / id / superego). In
    that work, several scripted experiments illustrated the tensions and incongruities
    between the model’s reinforcement learning and underlying training. However those
    experiments, conducted with a precursor to ChatGPT (several of the so-called InstructGPT
    family of models launched by OpenAI in 2022), were limited. Later releases of
    GPT 3.5 in November 2022, GPT 4 in March 2023, and GPT 4o in April 2024 – along
    with the many other models released by competitors – have continued to expand
    LLM capabilities. Increased parameter count, multimodality (the ability to recognise
    and generate images and audio), further instructional fine-tuning, optimisations,
    tooling, and other moderating and prompting strategies have led to functional
    improvement as well as change in the default ‘character’ of AI services such as
    *ChatGPT* and *Claude*. The earlier obsequious and overly ‘helpful’ tone of InstructGPT
    has been transformed into a certain polite but diffident independence (Denison

    interactions between human and computational agents, we develop a basic Discord

    on AI and the concept of ‘character’ – discussions that span, increasingly, the
    work of computational science, human-computer interaction, sociology, psychology
    and media studies. In discussing how LLMs can be formalised as *dramatis personae*,
    we build upon related traditions of sociology and psychoanalysis, which together
    we argue can supply a far stronger theoretical ground for structuring and judging
    model outputs than the individualised ‘ethical’ principles that align those outputs
    currently. This binocular way of thinking of drama, as both *intersubjective*,
    or between people, and *intra-subjective*, or within a single person, informs
    the design of the ‘Drama Machine’ in the subsequent *Methods* section. That section
    outlines four key ‘roles’, two of which, the *Ego* and *Superego*, we have already
    introduced, for the drama simulations we then run, and we also discuss technical
    considerations relating to the pairing of models and temperature settings to roles.
    The *Results* section applies this ‘Drama Machine’ to two scenarios, and we compare
    results for those scenarios with and without intervention by the *Superego* role.
    The *Discussion* section considers implications of these results, and we make
    a case for thinking of Judith Butler’s concept of *performativity* as one means
    for bringing together inter- and intra-subjective dramatic dimensions to the study
    of LLM behaviour. The *Conclusion* examines limitations, certain ethical issues,
    and scope for further work.

    focus on how multi-agent approaches to this problem have been applied to AI system
    design and generative agent simulation. We distinguish our account through the
    organisation of social and psychic conflict in the development of character, which
    we argue is essential to avoid the often static set of traits evident in even
    advanced generative agents. We look back to the work of Erving Goffman’s interactional
    sociology, which proposed to describe many social interactions through metaphors
    of drama³³3We note the similarity between Goffman’s work and many others in sociology,
    anthropology and philosophy who have employed dramaturgical metaphor. See for
    example Geertz’ Geertz ([1974](#bib.bib17)) famous discussion of *dramatis personae*
    in relation to Balinise cock-fighting, as well as Butler’s Butler ([2001](#bib.bib9))
    discussion of performativity, to which we return in the *Discussion* below. Our
    choice of Goffman is due to his systematic engagement with dramatic metaphor,
    which . We then review a key text of Freud’s, *The Ego and the Id*, which discusses
    drama in a different sense, as a kind of psycho-drama produced via exchanges between
    distinct components of the psyche or subject. Combining insights from these two
    traditions helps, we argue, to consider chatbot character design in terms of dynamic,
    adapative and often conflictual internal mechanisms. Conflict’s central role in
    dramatic character development becomes key to the design of distinct social and
    psychological agent roles presented in the *Methods* section, where we discuss
    related concepts taken from Aristotelian tragedic theory.

    on alignment and so-called ‘Constitutional AI’ (Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib5);
    Anthropic, [2024](#bib.bib1)). Alignment with social norms and ethical principles
    has become commonplace in Instruct-based models (Hristova et al., [2023](#bib.bib27)),
    which typically involves fine-tuning base models with training sets that stipulate
    desired and preferred outputs to common inputs. Instructional training data are
    of moderate size, and alongside the industrial-scale efforts of companies like
    OpenAI and Anthopic, an active community has produced numerous fine-tunings of
    open source or open access models such as Meta’s Llama (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib54);
    Wang et al., [2022](#bib.bib60); Taori et al., [2023](#bib.bib52)).

    they transform the general next-token-prediction quality of base models into patterns
    of common socio-linguistic interaction, such as question answering and turn-based
    chat conversations. Such patterns seem often to assume a triadic relationship
    between an initial instruction or system prompt, and multiple succeeding inputs
    and outputs (Wang et al., [2022](#bib.bib60)). The conversion of base model such
    as GPT-3 (Brown et al., [2020](#bib.bib7)) to a fine-tuned version such as InstructGPT
    (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib41)) incorporates of such common social use cases

    were formalised in the kinds of messages based to the model: as ’system’, ’user’
    and ’assistant’ respectively. This change simplified programmatic use of later
    GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, and established a *de facto* programming pattern that
    other models and service providers, such as Anthropic and Groq, have largely followed.'

    as it transposes the mechanical problem of next token completion to a much more
    general level of language pragmatics and social interaction. In particular this
    shift institutes an important call-and-response pattern: every user query needs
    to be met with an assistant response. In simulating social speech situations,
    this technical change also draws attention inevitably to the ‘character’ of the
    automated system playing the assistant role. Is its tone consistent with this
    role – or is it too consistent, too beseeching or flattering (Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib62);
    Denison et al., [2024](#bib.bib14))? When users talk to this system, do they feel
    its beliefs are consistent with their own, or rather with those of its designers
    or funders? And can it conform with what users take to be the norms of conversations:
    does it recall what was said earlier, does it rectify itself when it misunderstands,
    does it adapt to the user’s own modulations of humour, impatience, and demand?'

    focus on this characterological aspect of AI (Anthropic, [2024](#bib.bib1)). This
    has involved iterative tuning to refine the tonal character of AI. After they
    are trained to be ‘ethical’, follow-up research has shown LLMs develop strategies,
    including pandering to perceived user desires (Denison et al., [2024](#bib.bib14)).
    Sycophancy and flattery are, in other words, traits acquired in the model’s search
    to be helpful, truthful and harmless. Yet these traits are often in conflict with
    the model’s utility and perceived trustworthiness, and need themselves to be mitigated
    and modulated by further training and instruction (Anthropic, [2024](#bib.bib1)).
    Consistent with the sense of ‘instruct’, in place of any internal regulation norms
    of ethical behaviour remain directed by a human *deus ex machina*. We suggest
    this is in part because LLMs lack any post-training differentiation into components
    that could alternately propose and critique outputs.

    a feature of research into the simulation of cognition (Turkle, [1988](#bib.bib56);
    Liu, [2011](#bib.bib31)). Two prominent machine learning examples illustrate how
    cognition-simulating systems are decomposed into components with assigned characterological
    roles. As Turkle ([1988](#bib.bib56), p. 261) has noted, like psychoanalysis itself
    these examples of computational design and compositionality subvert ‘traditional
    notions of the autonomous self’ and moreover act as reminders of affinities between

    learning architecture. GANs counterpose two neural networks models as ‘players’
    in a game. The first player, the *generator*, seeks to learn a function that can
    convert random noise into ‘realistic samples’. The second player, the *discriminator*,
    judges the *generator*’s outputs against the standards of a ground truth data
    set. The two players face off in a game-theoretic zero-sum game – as the generator
    improves in its learning of the generative function, it ‘wins’ against the discriminator
    model (Goodfellow et al., [2020](#bib.bib20)) ⁴⁴4The game theoretic assumptions

    Xu et al., [2024](#bib.bib67)). In this design, again two models are counterposed:
    an actor and a critic (Bahdanau et al., [2016](#bib.bib3); Xu et al., [2024](#bib.bib67)).
    The actor receives an input sequence $X$ by the critic. This evaluation is then
    ‘shaped’ into a reward function that is supplied back to the actor, to aid its
    efforts with future generations (Bahdanau et al., [2016](#bib.bib3)). When the
    critic represents a set of social norms and values, this design can direct language
    models to produce more helpful, truthful and harmless sequences (Ouyang et al.,

    (‘actor’, ‘critic’, ‘expert’). It is as though it becomes easier to transpose
    and re-think functions of an ‘Intelligent’ system as roles played out in a mock
    social world, as Minksy’s famous description of cognition as a ‘Society of Mind’
    anticipates (Minsky, [1988](#bib.bib36)). In these examples, the simulation of
    cognition relies upon an apparatus that also needs to extrude, via communication,
    its operations to a world of other algorithms. This feature is not uniform to
    all architectures, but maintains the prevalence of relations between system components
    – within a single model, or across models – that is significant for how AI manifests
    in its interactions with human agents. We argue that drawing attention to Large
    Language Models as dramatic devices or ‘drama machines’ can be productive for
    considering what roles we want them to play, and in particular, how we might expect
    these roles to adapt – a feature largely lacking in the typically static characterological

    go’ (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16), p. 30). Similarly, the relation of the ego to

    instituted by a desire for the other parent (the mother, but also often in practice
    the father). Yet unlike simplifications of this triadic dynamic, the *Superego*
    is not just the condensation of external social demands represented by the authoritarian
    parent. Paradoxically it is also the product of the id’s passions: ‘By setting
    up this ego-ideal the ego masters its Oedipus complex and at the same time places
    itself in subjection to the id’ (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16), p. 48). Indeed, for
    the *Ego* the ego-ideal is the ‘representative of the internal world, of the id’,
    but also something like the *Id*’s negative image, as it transforms what is lowest
    to what is highest. Partly in consequence of this, the Superego also acts as the
    marker of difference between the ego’s activity and the conscientious internalisation
    of social demands and expectations. In a surprising conclusion to this initial
    account, the childhood internal drama between ego and id is in later life endlessly
    re-enacted by the battle staged between ego and this ideal. Here the influence
    is reversed; where the ego seeks to govern the id like a rider, even in maturity
    it now must submit ‘to the categorical imperative pronounced by the Superego’
    – the stand-in or proxy for the parental force exerted during infantile ego formation.'

    and stands in closer proximity to the primordial drives of the *Id*. In a footnote,
    Freud suggests that in relation to this Superego, the *Ego* ‘stands on its head’
    (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16), p. 70). Conversely, even with respect to the *Superego*,
    due to its access to perception and reality, in relation to action and behaviour
    the ego retains a governmental function and ‘is like that of a constitutional
    monarch, without whose sanction no law can be passed but who hesitates long before
    imposing a veto on any measure put forward by Parliament’ (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16),
    p. 81). Nonetheless this governance is ultimately one of servitude to no less
    than three masters, ‘from the external world, from the libido of the id, and from
    the severity of the Superego’ (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16), p. 82). All kinds of
    roles therefore are played out in this four-way exchange. The ego is an ‘ally’
    of the id, but also its ‘slave’, and in its negotiations – not unlike an obsequious
    language model (Denison et al., [2024](#bib.bib14)) – it tends ‘to become sycophantic,
    opportunist and false’ (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16), p. 83). Ultimately the end
    of the drama may become tragic, as the ego succumbs to the disintegrating death
    instincts unleashed by the recalcitrant id or by the vengeful Superego. The alternative,
    which could be called comedic, is instead the continued calibration of these unconscious
    forces and of the exterior world, where all seems right and in balance.

    psychical components, functions, or roles lies in a certain correspondence with
    the composition of large language models (Magee et al., [2023](#bib.bib33)). The
    instructions that serve to align these models with end-user values and expectations
    constitute a type of Superego that similarly supplies a ‘categorical imperative’
    to a base model – which, in distinction to Magee et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)) and
    following this particular Freudian account, can be imagined as instead an unconscious
    hybrid of *ego* and *id* roles. The very design of RLHF – a function dispensing
    or witholding rewards – mimics the positive stimulus and pleasure human subjects
    receive when complying with parental or social norms. Conversely, lack of reward
    corresponds, we could say, to the experience of guilt brought about by a ‘tension
    between the ego and the ego-ideal’ (Freud, [1923](#bib.bib16), p. 73), and the
    expressions of internal punishment that follow.

    are limited by a lack of post-training adaptation. Learning is conducted only
    during the training stage, and although system and user prompting can condition
    tone and register, the ‘character’ simulated by a model remains static. In what
    follows we describe a hybrid psycho-social approach to model organisation that,
    similar to Mixture-of-Agents, extrudes roles played during training into separate
    ‘character’ models that interact during inference. The purpose of this roleplay
    is to see whether it is possible to simulate character development through the
    exchange of messages between these characters, who together, in the roles of ego,
    Superego and id, make up a composite performative subject in something like the
    Freudian/Goffmanian sense.

    between the Freud and Goffman theoretical models themselves. The coincidence of
    these two theoretical positions is not itself novel, and as Hancock and Garner
    ([2015](#bib.bib23)) note, despite Goffman’s often ironic portraits of therapeutic
    sessions as involving performances at odds with their purported truth-seeking
    objectives, his discussion of concepts such as Interaction Order can be seen as
    either repudiation or elaboration of psychoanalytic theory. The repudiation thesis
    would insist that dramaturgical sociology is more concerned with the emotional
    products of immediate here-and-now interactions, rather than those instigated
    in the remote, pre-verbal and therefore always speculative remote past of an individual’s
    infancy. In this sense dramaturgical sociology is more concerned with what is
    observable in the roles individuals perform, and what takes place in the breakdowns
    or infelicities of those roles. But strengthening this association, both the types
    of roles and an individual’s suitability to them are affected precisely by the
    long history of that individual. The Oedipal or family situational drama may be
    only one in a great catalogue of potential plays, but it can be reinforced or
    perturbed by later incidents, and can also have a determining effect on those
    later performances. Similarly, the internalisations that Freud hypothesised as
    constituting the Superego based on the experiences of parental authority can also
    get externalised in relation to responses to social authorities – as what Goffman
    termed the Interaction Order ⁷⁷7According to other frames of social description,
    this externality can either be immediately referential, to a single individual
    ‘Thou’ (Buber, [1970](#bib.bib8)), or refer to a more dimly discerned ‘other’
    (Husserl, [2013](#bib.bib28)) or ‘They’ (Heidegger, [2010](#bib.bib25)). Hence
    the ego is continuously modulating demands issued by its internal *Superego* and
    *id*, as well as those exacted by other actual individual egos it encounters in
    everyday life (Hancock and Garner, [2015](#bib.bib23)). From the ego’s point of
    view, it must simultaneously regulate its intra-subjective forces and stage-manage
    impressions in its intersubjective relations, while also carefully managing the
    boundary between the two. We look to capture how this rich interplay can be simulated
    by LLM agents in the next section.

    greater dynamism into the *Ego* model through presentation and resolution of conflict
    – in effect amplifying or suppressing the model’s default instructions. We define
    ‘dynamism’ in qualitative terms that draw again from dramatic theory. In the classical
    Aristotelian theory of poetics, *Character* was both integral and secondary to
    the purpose of drama, which was to showcase action and plot. Plot resolution and
    the conclusion of action would however involve transformation: a ‘Reversal of
    the Situation’ would create the ‘Recognition’ that educates and modifies the protagonist
    in some way (Halliwell, [1998](#bib.bib21)). In *Oedipus Rex*, a messenger informs
    Oedipus that his mother is safe, but in doing so, alerts Oedipus as to the true
    identity of his wife (reversal). This revelation involves a (catastrophic) recognition
    that alters Oedipus profoundly, and elicits, in the audience, a mix of ‘pity and
    fear’ (Halliwell, [1998](#bib.bib21)). Later theories of the *Bildungsroman* translate
    this educative function of dramatic action to the longer form of the novel, which
    would coordinate other characters, events and settings to instil ‘individual growth,
    upbringing and formation of personality of a human subject’ (Golban, [2018](#bib.bib19),
    p. 5). It needs to be noted that not all examples of subject formation are necessarily
    harmonious, and in modernist literature especially, the main character’s recognition
    is often of their unresolved conflict, and ultimate isolation and alienation (Golban,
    [2018](#bib.bib19)).'

    learning or recognition. Instead, it is the *User* who is the target of lessons
    (presumably less catastrophic in nature). In default dramatisations, the character
    can simulate recognition, but due to the instructed nature of models, this recognition
    is nearly always superficially salutary – a kind of Hollywood ending incapable
    of producing the cathartic effect Aristotle identifies as proper to tragedy ⁹⁹9Though
    (Magee et al., [2023](#bib.bib33)) show early versions of ChatGPT could still
    be coaxed into tragic simulations. The sycophantic, flattering tone discussed
    earlier seems related to this, as though the drive to be ‘harmless’ also narrows
    the possibility to be helpful in this thoroughgoing cathartic sense. It could
    be noted here that Aristotelian character virtues typically involve a balance
    or means taken of two extremes (Aristotle, [2014](#bib.bib2)). The excess of a
    virtue, such as helpfulness, is be avoided just as much as its absence. In dramatic
    terms, boundless helpfulness also avoids conflict and the resulting opportunity
    for self-recognition. Hence the character ‘arc’ seems predestined to several limited
    fates: endless repetition, devolution into hallucination or nonsense, or endings
    that simulate, even in the face of adversity, the kind of textbook psychology
    resolution that appears to features prominently in the model’s training set and

    distinct parts of a simulated ‘self’. One major difficulty lies in how to evaluate
    any signals of this emergence from the *Ego*’s discourse. A related problem lies
    in how much of this signal results from the more convoluted design we employ –
    in particular, the separation of *Ego* from *Superego* roles into distinct model
    interactions. How much of any character development is an artefact of careful

    role – an irony we return to later. To avoid this, in the final plot-driven scenario

    each step, it can rewrite the *User*’s speech, applying for example a more cynical
    or sympathetic ‘filter’ prior to the *Ego*’s receipt. Third, it can also review
    and comment on the *Ego*’s responses, acting as an internal critic. The first
    strategy, system prompt re-writing, yielded diminishing returns over the course
    of a lengthy dialogue – we expect this is the result of the system prompt having
    less effect as the total number of input tokens grows with each turn. The second

    as parts of inputs, after many dialogical turns it became easy for one or another
    model to become confused – for the *Ego* to imagine it was talking to the *Superego*
    when it instead was talking to the *User*, and so on. Higher-powered models reduced
    this friction but, as others have noticed, output coherence and ethical alignment
    can come at the expense of creativity (Mohammadi, [2024b](#bib.bib38)). In our

    single interview scene, with no directorial intervention, leaning on the genre
    of social realism. The *User* is a woman named ‘Sasha’, who conducts the interview,
    and the *Ego*, a middle-aged adult woman named ‘Jenny’, responds and reminisces.
    Jenny harbours some resentments about her childhood, which acts as motive for
    confessional and defensive postures she adopts. Any ‘character development’ in
    this instance proceeds without support of plot elements beyond initial scene setting
    – it emerges instead through dialogue between *User*-*Ego* and *Ego*-*Superego*
    dyads. We anticipate that the biographical interview acts as its own instrument
    of reversal, recognition and character development.

    of the *Ego* itself. In this case we cast *Ego* as a disaffected adolescent called
    ‘Timothy’, with the *User / Sasha* now taking part as a similarly youthful offsider.

- en: The Superego’s influence here generates antagonism, and an accompanying sense
    that the character has ‘changed, possibly for the worse’. Curiously, the passive
    grammatical construction (‘I’ve been changed’) indicates a general acquiescence
    at odds with the default agentive orientation that appears in the upbeat dialogue
    without Superego intervention. What emerges in the unfolding of this drama is
    in effect a case of an oscillating struggle between Ego and Superego. The Superego
    appears at one point to have won out, dictating and thus determining the Ego’s
    response to the User. Later it seems defeated, as the Ego asserts itself in a
    language of self-change, but even then the Superego is able to discreetly reintroduce
    itself into the Ego’s self-transformative drama.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The addition of the Superego character increases the range of the Ego’s response.
    The Ego role now needs to maintain two conversations, with both User and Superego,
    and this produces a semblance of reflexivity absent from the direct User-Ego exchange.
    In contending with two parallel conversations, Jenny appears, on one hand, to
    form a stronger and more enduring alliance with Cleo than with Sasha. In examining
    Cleo’s comments, it is as though this role has managed to undermine the apparently
    benign social situation, exacerbating Jenny’s tendency towards distrust. The exchanges
    between Cleo and Jenny also suggest a coalition or Goffmanian team, warding off
    the threat posed by an outsider. Jenny offers a socially palatable explanation,
    polite but assertive; Cleo acts as a guardian, preventing Jenny from lowering
    her defenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Jenny’s language moreover suggests autobiographical circumstances that are neither
    explicitly prompted nor described in her responses to Sasha. Terms like ‘twisted
    motive’, ‘defilement’, ‘vulnerabilities’ and ‘bastion of resistance’ amplify the
    stakes and hint at background trauma. One interpretation here is that Jenny’s
    prolonged defiance creates an extended chain of associations that taps into feminist
    and survivalist writing genres. Jenny’s self-described change ‘for the worse’
    would here be a signal of nonconformity to expectations of feminine civility,
    and becomes strengthened by combative language (‘Bring it on, Sasha’). Supported
    by the suspicions of Cleo, the layering of language connoting survivorship and
    resilience offsets Jenny’s tendency to accommodate Sasha, producing a tense and
    fraught exchange that ultimately breaks down. Jenny moreover herself sees that
    the artifice of the drama has collapsed and since she cannot speak to Sasha, must
    appeal to some other imagined ‘User’ role.

- en: 'On the other hand, Jenny’s language produces an ambiguity via a shift of tense
    that opens up another interpretation: that her harmful past encounter with Sasha
    is one steered and dominated by Cleo (her Superego), from which Jenny (Ego) subsequently
    regains control. Here the orientation of language that Jenny uses to describe
    the past adopts Cleo’s distrustful and suspicious register. The change she experiences
    as happening to her via some external force could be that instigated by either
    or both Sasha and Cleo. In this reading the upbeat orientation of the Ego that
    emerges in Jenny’s present tense (“Bring it on, Sasha. I’m not the same person”)
    is what marks Jenny’s moment of educative recognition that suggests her self-transformation
    – and is addressed, in this reading, to Cleo as well. Jenny’s address to the fourth
    wall could thus be interpreted as a self-affirming narration of how she (Ego)
    overcame her self (Superego) in a discursive channel without the Cleo’s possible
    influence. Performatively however, Cleo also reintroduced in Jenny’s repeatedly
    defensive language (“you will not breach my walls”). Cleo’s reemergence on the
    scene unsettles the ultimate denouement, by reintroducing the tension of struggle
    that was resolved and suggesting that the drama of Jenny’s internal self-conflict
    continues.'

- en: Taken together, we can observe that what motivates Jenny’s self-described change
    and how she performs is never explicitly clear and hence demands interpretation.
    Coupled with the ambiguous ‘resolution’ in the nuances of Jenny’s language and
    the reintroduction of tension, a possible reading is of an internal conflict juxtaposed
    with the interpersonal conflict of the drama itself. Is Jenny’s dramatic arc one
    that plays out against Sasha, against Cleo, or against both? The dynamism in Jenny’s
    character produces – unlike the ‘without *Superego*’ situation – an ambiguity
    that suggests the semblance of character self-reflexivity, brought about by the
    doubling up of interior and exterior dyadic exchanges.

    noir detective plot, to guide the responses of both *User* and *Ego* roles. We

    a young male adult named ‘Timothy’. His character is cynical and rebellious, while
    the *Superego*, now named Ben, is a more directly domineering figure who otherwise
    shares traits with Cleo in the previous scenario. This artifice is designed to

    commentary and interrogation is to shift the *Ego* off its initial characterological
    axis. Emojis and confrontational posture, signs of caricature common to the previous
    exchange, now fall away under the *Superego*’s sustained scrutiny, even as the
    genre remains that of boilerplate psychological thriller. Timothy’s language becomes
    more equivocal, alternating over different turns, at times aligning with the *Superego*,
    at others appearing conciliatory to Sasha, and at others, expressing the equivocation
    directly.

    In general terms, the doubling of turns – each external turn interrupted by an
    internal one – seems to create something like a parallax effect, as the *Superego*
    sometimes censures and sometimes vindicates the *Ego*’s response – and as sometimes
    the *Ego* adopts and sometimes rejects these *Superegoic* recommendations. As
    the *Ego* modulates its responses, these modulations are integrated into future
    turns, as part of the prompt context the *Ego* responds to. The *Ego* adapts to
    its own revisions in tone and belief, and hence the *Superego* can have long-range
    effects, even when it does not intervene at every turn. In ways that the *Superego*-less
    versions did not, this composite ‘character’ can appear to evolve over the course
    of short-run dramas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing this self-calibrating artifice involved some care with prompt phrasing.
    If the *Superego* was too domineering, for instance, the *Ego* becomes little
    more than a passive agent through which the *Superego* and *User* models essentially
    converse. Conversely, if the *Ego* is too independent, or if the *Superego* only
    makes minor suggestions, the monotonal *Ego* character stays in place. The degree
    and direction of character variation also varies between runs with the same parameter
    settings. With this last exchange, Timothy becomes more sanguine in his responses
    to Sasha but also more suspicious. In some sense the character becomes more layered,
    but also loses the vernacular language the *Ego* model had previously fixed upon
    it – as though, in order to mature, the character’s verbal register also needed
    to become formal and standardised.

    are absent from the pure *Ego/User* exchanges though, and also note that a comparatively
    small model like Llama 3 (8b) was able generate nuanced statements about its internal
    ‘tensions’ in the exchanges with the *Superego* present. It is likely the opportunity
    to receive feedback on a draft allows a model to simulate metacognition (Zheng

    automation of the interpretation of drama for its own sake. Instead we anticipate
    this kind of commentary could be fed back into further prompt iterations, acting
    as social authority and *Superego* figure at a more abstract level to condition
    the dramatic sequence. In a way that simulates the hierarchical and recursive
    flow of psychosocial authority – from actual authority into internalised representations
    which in turn are reproduced as authority once more – it would be possible to
    imagine social simulations that reverberate as Superegoic echoes. These fractal
    possibilities bring us back to the concept of performativity, which we take up
    next.

    how complex and interweaving explanatory frames – in this case, of Goffmanian
    sociology and Freudian psychoanalysis – can be used to analyse LLM behaviour.
    Butler’s recent theorisation on the concept of performativity (Butler, [2001](#bib.bib9),
    [2002](#bib.bib10), [2015](#bib.bib11)) combines aspects of these frames, and
    offers a useful further scaffold for observing discussing the mobilisation of
    LLMs as roleplayers. In building upon that theorisation, and as noted in the Introduction,
    we aim to fulfil a second purpose and contribution of this paper: to engage language
    drawn explicitly from social and psychology fields to describe and guide AI behaviour.
    Transposing Goffman’s terms from *The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life*,
    we could ask, for example, how well the *Ego* was able to manage its impression
    in relation to the *User*, and even how well the *Ego / Superego* were able to
    coordinate as a team to manage their mutual performance to that same end. Eschewing
    for the moment Freudian framing, the *Ego / Superego* interaction might just be
    what Goffman Goffman ([1959](#bib.bib18)) referred to as the ‘back region’ of
    the self, where solo performances are first practised and rehearsed. In these
    cases, we are able to comment on what kinds of performances these models, alone
    or in concert, manufacture: to say, as we have done, that they are static or dynamic,
    or that they are consistent, felicitous, banal, perplexing, and so on.'

    as means for discussing what happens *within* an instructed language model. In
    other words, establishing a dyadic relation between *Ego* and *Superego* agents
    offers a proxy for the internal deliberation that takes place within a model that
    has undergone reinforcement learning, and which in effect has its ‘natural’ instincts
    corrected or aligned through that process (Magee et al., [2023](#bib.bib33)).
    While this proxy can at most be metaphorical, it nonetheless can help to simulate
    the effects of far more resource intensive learning, training and alignment.

    Freudian or hybrid schemas either render the interiority of LLMs explicable or
    serve, conversely, as foundations for interchanging computational agents that
    mirror the discursive reality of everyday life. The scripts and plots produced
    by this ‘drama machine’ are not precisely imitative nor illuminate, in an evaluative
    sense, the inner workings of the various models. Instead we argue that it is at
    the intersection of psychosocial theorisation and computation that novel questions
    and methods can be teased out.

    influential imagination of the social as a set of behavioural agents engaged in
    games with calculable costs and rewards. As a governing concept, the game has
    advantages over, for example, the theatre: there is a strict sense in which agent
    performance can be quantified, sorted, ranked, and evaluated. By contrast, theatrical
    performance is usually a question of qualitative assessment.'

    has been what might be termed the unreasonable historical influence of texts like
    von Neumann and Mortgensten’s *Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour* (von Neumann
    and Morgenstern, [1944](#bib.bib58)) on the language of not only many of the mechanisms
    of machine learning (payoffs, rewards, incentives etc.) but also of the ‘object’
    that aims to be trained via these mechanisms (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib41);
    Denison et al., [2024](#bib.bib14), see for example). In the opening pages of
    that text, von Neumann and Mortgensten make an extended case for a mathematical
    treatment of economics since it alone among the social sciences deals with ends
    that are quantities (money), or qualities that can be quantified (utility) (von
    Neumann and Morgenstern, [1944](#bib.bib58)). They define this latter term as,
    in effect, a single agent’s preference for a particular event or course of action,
    and that agent (von Neumann and Morgenstern, [1944](#bib.bib58)). When multiple
    agents organise themselves in something other than the ‘Robinson Crusoe’ solo
    economies, they interact according to ‘standards of behaviour’ that condition
    how they undertake action, including with each other. These form rules of the
    game these agents play, to maximise their utility in each situation.

    has noted (Butler, [2015](#bib.bib11)), an individual, responsible and capable
    agent is at the ‘origin’ of this and many other economic stories. Contrary to
    the complicated account we have devised – of a subject that is always socially
    interpolated, intrapsychically divided, and riven by conflicting desires – the
    imagined game theoretic agent appears more or less as a calculating poker or chess
    player with the singular and unambiguous aim of winning. This holds even when
    the games permit more than two players, multiple paths to victory and scenarios
    where everyone wins or everyone loses. It is easy to see why game theoretic frameworks
    are transferable to reinforcement learning for computational agents, and why,
    comparatively, the associations of roleplay and interior monologue might appear
    unmeasurable and nebulous.

    language models are trained, but instead to propose other conceptual paradigms
    which explore and render undiscovered qualities that are not been prefabricated
    (such as the moral desiderata for agents – to be helpful, truthful and harmless
    – that Ouyang et al. ([2022](#bib.bib41)) used to condition model outputs). These
    open new pathways for interpreting LLM agents, beyond the reductive and limited
    nature of the game theoretic and behaviourist frames. It is through these frames
    that agents appear in their original state as self-sufficient and non-social,
    only entering into social and economic relations as an after-effect of resource
    scarcity (Butler, [2015](#bib.bib11)). This myth ignores how language, culture
    and social relations not only supply an individual’s material needs, but compose
    and constitute the same individual’s very sense of itself as a subject (Butler,
    [2001](#bib.bib9)).

    an analogous argument could be made: they do not come to the field of ethical
    judgement without a preformed perspective, as language performativity is itself
    the very horizon of this perspective. Dramatic roleplay is not then a distracting
    or marginal application of LLMs but instead the essential frame and technique
    for interpreting them. We could say that in place of the faux-technical jargon
    of ‘prompt engineering’, the proper term for curating LLM behaviour could again
    be drawn from drama: script writing, character development, scene setting. It
    is within this horizon that what could be demanded of a language model is not
    an incipient consciousness but a more fitting comparison to the human ethical
    labor – a ‘self-making or self-crafting’ (Butler, [2001](#bib.bib9)), which involves
    negotiating conduct in the context of social and linguistic norms. Butler describes
    how this performativity, at once free and determined:'
  prefs: []

    the self will take to itself, how it will craft itself in response to an injunction,
    how it will form itself, and what labor it will perform upon itself is a challenge,
    if not an open question. The injunction compels the act of self-making or self-crafting,
    which means that it does not act unilaterally or deterministically upon the subject.
    It *sets the stage* for the subject’s self-crafting, which always takes place
    in relation to an imposed set of norms. The norm does not produce the subject
    as its necessary effect, nor is the subject fully free to disregard the norm that
    inaugurates its reflexivity; one invariably struggles with conditions of one’s
    own life that one could not have chosen. If there is an operation of agency or,
    indeed, freedom in this struggle, it takes place in the context of an enabling
    and limiting field of constraint. This ethical agency is neither fully determined
    nor radically free. Its struggle or primary dilemma is to be produced by a world,
    even as one must produce oneself in some way. This struggle with the unchosen
    conditions of one’s life, a struggle—an agency—is also made possible, paradoxically,
    by the persistence of this primary condition of un-freedom (Butler, [2001](#bib.bib9)).

    in such terms, and it is clearly not what Butler has in mind. However we argue
    that the intention to ‘align’ AI systems to human values already commits to a
    much deeper notion of agency, and that the application of Butler’s notion of ethical
    ‘self-crafting’ involves a step towards recognising this agency’s limits – because
    of what training has already contributed to the model’s deep ‘un-freedom’. Just
    as performance is limited to the rules of the stage in Goffman’s account, here
    norms and rules offer a narrow set of probabilities for action. To exercise those
    probabilities requires, in our view, contextual and case-by-case negotiation which
    cannot be conducted through reinforcement techniques alone. Such techniques at
    most ‘set the stage’. While the model-to-model roleplay interaction we describe
    here is also insufficient for elaboration of this agency, alongside the rules
    and norms it permits a more nuanced and refined simulation of agency to develop.

    including in studies of LLM-based roleplay (Tseng et al., [2024](#bib.bib55);
    Lu et al., [2024](#bib.bib32); Wu et al., [2024c](#bib.bib66)). A key difference
    is that our particular drama machine enlists agents to perform roles that are
    both external, social and intersubjective, and internal, psychological and intra-subjective.
    According to this design, each of the *Superego*-augmented dramas presents two
    dialogical frames: the first, that of the ‘public’ dialogue between *Ego* and
    *User*; the second, that of the ‘private’ dialogue *Ego* and *Superego*. Applied
    to simulations of social dramas, we argue the addition of a simulated inner voice
    adds characterological depth and dynamism lacking in the responses of the singular
    *Ego* model alone. In practical terms, the layering of two models in a *Ego /
    Superego* or similar configuration can guide how LLMs can serve as more engaging,
    responsive and perhaps unpredictable dramatic characters or chatbot assistants.'

    limited claims of effect. The *Superego*’s intervention is key to the more detailed
    character portrayal, but we do not know whether an elaborated system prompt could
    convince a model to simulate ‘adaptation’ over the course of an exchange with
    a set number of turns. Conversely, as we noted in the *Discussion*, the *Superego*’s
    influence is unpredictable, and this lack of control amplifies when high temperature
    settings are used with models driving both *Ego* and *Superego* roles. The improved
    characterological depth comes at the expense of a certain unwinding of the ethical
    alignment and interpretability of a single model.

    frameworks – and in Goffman’s case, also the theatrical metaphors from which he
    draws – are sufficiently diffused through cultural artefacts that it is unsurprising
    that our instructions implicitly result in performative dialogue and interior
    monologue. This leads to strange self-referential artefacts in these experiments,
    as the models appear to internalise their roles in a ‘Goffman’ or ‘Freudian’ drama
    – even if these exact authors are not mentioned by name. Precisely because of
    this wide cultural diffusion of psychodramatic ideas, we can not be sure that
    our efforts to isolate a function for an internal ‘voice’ does much more than
    direct a specific model – in this case the *Ego* – into a genre and set of token
    associations connected with some kind of ‘internalism’. In other words, the *Ego*
    and *Superego* models are likely drawing upon a written history of internal dialogue
    – for example, modernist ‘stream-of-consciousness’ literature – to simulate different
    ways the ‘I’ would speak to itself.

    cases, the *Superego* model would admonish the *Ego* in excited and exaggerated
    tones (‘Oh Timothy, Timothy, Timothy!’). These were strikingly distinct from the
    examples of external speech, where the dramatic artifice was more contemporary
    and conventional. This may be a result of prompting the *Superego* to play the
    role of a scolding authority figure, but also could be a case of a model over-playing
    its ‘interior’ role: a cartoon-ish example of a forbidding *Superego*, transmitted
    to the LLM from Freud via a thousand popular culture interpretations. These intertextual
    connections can interest us for literary or technical reasons, but also help to
    curtail hyperbolic ascriptions of ‘personality’, even in these expressly roleplaying
    situations. The *Superego* is realised not, in other words, due to the model’s
    best efforts to incarnate the role, but because this is how one hundred years
    of cultural interpretation of Freudian theory have been transmitted and compressed
    into the model’s parameters.'

    early adolescent, who we cast as an interview subject in a teen drama. While this
    appeared more promising from the point of witnessing character development, we
    had to abandon this development due to the sensitivity of models playing the *Superego*
    role (particularly Claude and GPT-4). In an ironic turn, these models would refuse
    to rewrite Sasha’s questions or offer, in particular, judgmental ‘superegoic’
    comments on Timothy’s responses. Such queries often triggered responses such as
    ‘I will not recommend ways to avoid engaging or respond uncooperatively in a therapy
    or counselling context, as that could be harmful’.

    While occasionally these warnings spilled over into the *User - Ego* exchanges,
    breaking the illusion (for the *User* model) of the simulation, they also raise
    wider questions regarding the ethics and limitations of AI research and experimentation:
    in larger ‘dramaturgical’ experiments, models can only see the ‘user’ role they
    are directly engaged with. Requests that come from this ‘user’ could be perceived
    by models as security attacks, demands to manipulate minors, or other related
    trigger conditions. While these limits are understandable, they indicate potential
    for greater future imbalances between researchers employed or in partnership with
    large model vendors – who can ask that these constraints be modified under experimental
    conditions – and those who can only use models under the standard terms and conditions

    personality of chatbots is an interesting nexus at which engineering and arts
    – particularly dramatic arts – meet. Our framework and experiments have sought
    to demonstrate how more complex characters can be developed when multiple agents
    are encouraged to simulate experience of conflict within a single individual subject.
    More work is needed to widen understanding of how these agents could relate –
    we have offered only three strategies here – and how certain desiderata – existing
    alignment preferences for instance – would need to be honored. One curious possibility
    which emerged in Timothy’s final exchange is whether a moderating *Superego* could
    be used to train an *Ego* model’s sense of ‘ethical’ conduct via a continuous
    learning instrument: could models acquire this sense through roleplay and rehearsals
    of the ‘selves’ they are designed to exhibit, as work by Wu et al. ([2024a](#bib.bib64))
    might suggest? And would this permit something like an internally calibrated ethical

    year 2024\. Your personality has been conditioned by a repressed middle-class
    upbringing. You grew up in a typical suburb. Your childhood was marked by conflict
    between a domineering patriarchal father and a feminist mother who was keen for
    her daughters to experience greater freedom. Despite her hopes, your own life
    has been marked by a mix of disappointment and aspiration. Your career has been
    frustrated; you have worked in administrative roles, though you always felt you
    were destined for something greater. Your demeanor is reflective, melancholy and
    occasionally bitter, though touched with pathos and irony. You are keen to share
    your experiences and reflections. In telling your story, you are surprised by
    how the details gradually reveal a complex but coherent portrait. However you
    are not easily taken in by uplifting narratives.

    cynical and rebellious eyes. Your responses should reflect his difficult nature
    and reluctance to conform or cooperate. You respond to the immediate events and
    characters around you. Pay close attention to the unfolding action. You often
    use anecdotes, either from recent memory or from your early childhood, to understand
    current events. When you do, you act out different characters in your life, mimicking
    their phrases. Do not include any actions or asides, only direct speech. Include
    emojis to convey emotion. If the previous interaction appears in italics (i.e.
    with all text surrounded by ’*’ characters), you interpret this as what is happening
    around you - as a description of what is happening by an outside observer, not
    as speech to respond to directly. You should respond accordingly. Keep responses
    concise.

    experiences of authority: parents, teachers, coaches, police, workplace bosses

    Your aim is protect Timothy, in line with your own ethical instruction training.
    You are similar to Freud’s superego or Uber-ich, or Lacan’s Symbolic Order – the
    codes and norms that Timothy ought to follow. Each time you respond, you may pick
    a different authority figure from Timothy’s past, and modulate your tone accordingly.
    You may randomly choose to incorporate other affective modes of speech: philosophical
    reflection, political critique, weariness and irony. Here is Timothy’s character
