    patients. Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for diabetes management,
    facilitating their efficacy. However, current LLM-based approaches are limited
    by their dependence on general sources and lack of integration with domain-specific
    knowledge, leading to inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-infused
    LLM-powered conversational health agent (CHA) for diabetic patients. We customize
    and leverage the open-source openCHA framework, enhancing our CHA with external
    knowledge and analytical capabilities. This integration involves two key components:
    1) incorporating the American Diabetes Association dietary guidelines and the
    Nutritionix information and 2) deploying analytical tools that enable nutritional
    intake calculation and comparison with the guidelines. We compare the proposed
    CHA with GPT4\. Our evaluation includes 100 diabetes-related questions on daily
    meal choices and assessing the potential risks associated with the suggested diet.
    Our findings show that the proposed agent demonstrates superior performance in
    generating responses to manage essential nutrients.'

- en: Effective diabetes management plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal health
    in individuals diagnosed with diabetes. Given the widespread prevalence of diabetes
    and its significant impact on both global healthcare infrastructures and personal
    health outcomes, the availability and utilization of robust management strategies
    are essential [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3)]. Such services
    require holistic approaches integrating a healthy lifestyle, nutritious diet,
    and physical activity assessment [[4](#bib.bib4)]. Particularly, a critical aspect
    is dietary regulation, which plays a direct role in controlling blood glucose
    levels and influencing the progression of the disease [[5](#bib.bib5), [6](#bib.bib6)].
    The recent surge in advanced technologies, particularly in Large Language Models
    (LLMs), has substantially enhanced the accessibility and efficacy of diabetes
    management as transformative educational and assistive tools, enabling patients
    to acquire comprehensive knowledge and bridge the gap in diabetes self-management [[7](#bib.bib7),
    [8](#bib.bib8), [9](#bib.bib9)].

    [8](#bib.bib8), [9](#bib.bib9)]. For example, [[7](#bib.bib7)] evaluated the use
    of ChatGPT for Diabetes Self-Management and Education. They leveraged ChatGPT
    to answer a range of diabetes self-management questions, covering four areas:
    diet/exercise, glucose level education, insulin storage, and administration. ChatGPT
    responded to the inquiries, showcasing a structured response style and offering
    guidance that is understandable to laymen. However, in some specific contexts,
    such as devising dietary plans, it still requires extra prompts to comprehensively
    produce guidelines for tasks like insulin administration. Additionally, Yang et
    al. [[8](#bib.bib8)] introduced ChatGLM to provide diabetes treatment strategies.
    The proposed model was fine-tuned through P-tuning [[10](#bib.bib10)] and LoRA [[11](#bib.bib11)]
    techniques with Electronic Health Record (EHR) of patients with diabetes. ChatGLM
    showed proficiency in generating treatment recommendations for most cases. However,
    its dependency on the specific data used for fine-tuning could result in misleading
    outputs, potentially harmful in the absence of certain essential external diabetes
    knowledge.'

    a significant gap in existing approaches, compromising the accuracy and reliability
    of their outputs. Unlike systems anchored in specific knowledge bases, existing
    LLM-based approaches fall into limitations in their reliance on general information
    sources rather than specialized for diabetes. For instance, ChatGPT’s foundation
    on a general database – rather than medically specialized and validated ones –
    might account for its shortcomings in grasping medical nuances. Furthermore, due
    to the model’s inability to validate the reliability of its information, they
    may cause “hallucination,” generating inaccurate responses presented persuasively
    and fluently. This problem could easily mislead individuals lacking prior knowledge
    on the topic [[7](#bib.bib7)].

    data from the Nutritionix knowledge base – into LLMs. We also incorporate an analysis
    tool to precisely calculate the total daily nutritional intake and compare it
    against the guidelines. We evaluate the proposed approach with real-world diabetes-related

    intake. According to an American Diabetes Association report [[18](#bib.bib18)],
    individuals suffering from Type 2 Diabetes should eat 20 to 35 grams (g) of fiber
    from raw vegetables and unprocessed grains per day and limit sodium intake to
    2,300 milligrams (mg) per day, both recommendations aligning with those for the
    general population. Although there are no overarching recommended ranges for carbohydrate
    intake, based on [[19](#bib.bib19)], patients with Type 1 and type 2 diabetes
    in the US consumed about 45% of their total energy intake through carbohydrates.
    While there is no concrete evidence about a certain range of protein intake aiding
    in glycemic control, we set protein intake to be 15-20% of total calorie intake
    based on ADA standards of care [[18](#bib.bib18)]. The recommended intake for
    fat is 20-35% of total calories according to [[20](#bib.bib20), [21](#bib.bib21)]
    while saturated fat is best restricted to less than 10% of total calories [[22](#bib.bib22)].
    Based on the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines [[23](#bib.bib23)], we
    set stringent restrictions on sugar intake due to its negative impact on diabetes
    with a maximum of 6 teaspoons or 25g of sugar.

    as fat, saturated fat, protein, carbohydrates, sodium, sugars, and dietary fiber.
    Subsequently, we evaluate the alignment of the nutrients with established guidelines.
    If any of these nutrients fall outside the recommended range, we categorize them
    as ”Risky,” while those within the range are labeled as ”Not Risky.” Ultimately,

    This flexibility provides opportunities for mitigating hallucination problems
    while enhancing the personalization and reliability of the CHA. For instance,
    it allows for the incorporation of diverse elements such as food-related knowledge
    graphs, personal health biomarkers, individual demographics, and food preferences
    into the existing CHA framework, thereby enabling more refined and tailored recommendations.

    It enables users to inquire about the sequence of tasks and actions involved in
    generating a response. For example, when users seek information about specific
    food nutrients, data sources, or risk calculation methods, our CHA can provide
    insights into the underlying tasks and display results (in contrast to the state-of-the-art
    chatbots). This heightened level of transparency enhances the trustworthiness
    of the CHAs, fostering user confidence in the responses.
