- en: The literature review is an indispensable step in the research process. It provides
    the benefit of comprehending the research problem and understanding the current
    research situation while conducting a comparative analysis of prior works. However,
    literature summary is challenging and time consuming. The previous LLM-based studies
    on literature review mainly focused on the complete process, including literature
    retrieval, screening, and summarization. However, for the summarization step,
    simple CoT method often lacks the ability to provide extensive comparative summary.
    In this work, we firstly focus on the independent literature summarization step
    and introduce *ChatCite*¹¹1Our code will be released after the review process.,
    an LLM agent with human workflow guidance for comparative literature summary.
    This agent, by mimicking the human workflow, first extracts key elements from
    relevant literature and then generates summaries using a Reflective Incremental
    Mechanism. In order to better evaluate the quality of the generated summaries,
    we devised a LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, in refer to the human
    evaluation criteria. The *ChatCite* agent outperformed other models in various
    dimensions in the experiments. The literature summaries generated by *ChatCite*
    can also be directly used for drafting literature reviews.

    innovative approaches in their fields. Crafting a literature review entails searching
    for relevant literature and conducting detailed comparative summarization. It
    typically involves two main steps: literature collection followed by literature
    summary generation based on the collected sources. However, organizing a high-quality
    literature review necessitates scholars to engage in thorough analysis, organization,
    comparison, and integration of an extensive of related works, which is often a

    of literature summary. However, machine-generated literature summaries often encounter
    challenges like information omission, lack of linguistic fluency, and insufficient
    comparative analysis. In traditional models, summaries generated through extraction
    and abstraction approach may miss key information due to the limitations of the
    model, leading to the lack of crucial points or findings of the generated summaries.
    Some automated systems may lack the ability for in-depth comparative analysis,
    potentially resulting in literature summaries that lack a comprehensive understanding
    of the relevant research in the field.

    Radford et al. ([2019](#bib.bib16)); Brown et al. ([2020](#bib.bib4)), their powerful
    capabilities in natural language generation tasks have been demonstrated across
    various tasks, that provides possibilities for handling longer texts and generating
    comprehensive summaries. Researchers have started exploring how to leverage LLMs
    to generate automatic literature summaries. Wei et al. ([2023](#bib.bib18)) propose
    a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method to enhance the ability of large language
    models to perform complex reasoning. CoT allows LLMs to devise their own plan,
    resulting in generated text that aligns more closely with human preferences.Recent
    study by Huang and Tan ([2023](#bib.bib10)) and Agarwal et al. ([2024](#bib.bib3))
    on literature review has focused more on how to retrieve relevant papers more
    accurately and neglected research on literature summarization. They use only simple
    CoT guidance to generate literature summaries, resulting in a lack of comparative
    and organizational analysis. Large language models, despite their fluent language
    generation, struggle to consistently produce comparative literature summaries
    due to their unpredictable an stochastic nature. The length limitations of these
    models require a two-step summarization approach, increasing the risk of information
    omission during abstract generation.

    above, our work proposes *ChatCite*, a LLM-based agent guided by human workflow.

    Prior studies on literature summarization have primarily relied on text summarization
    metrics, such as ROUGE (Lin ([2004a](#bib.bib12))). However, traditional text
    summary evaluation metrics, like ROUGE, are not sufficient to assess the quality
    of literature summaries. More comprehensive evaluation criteria covering multiple
    dimensions are required to ensure that the generated literature summaries truly
    meet the requirements. Therefore, we combine human studies on literature reviews
    Justitia and Wang ([2022](#bib.bib11)) to formulate the evaluation criteria for
    literature summaries from multiple dimensions ²²2Six evaluation dimensions are:
    Consistency, Coherence, Comparative, Integrity, Fluency, Cite Accuracy., and propose

    the challenges of information omission, lack of comparative summaries and organizational
    deficiencies. In ChatCite, the Key Element Extractor contributes to improving
    content consistency, and the Comparative Incremental Generator effectively enhances
    the organizational structure, comparative analysis, and citation accuracy of the
    generated summary. Additionally, the literature summaries generated by ChatCite
    can be directly used for drafting literature reviews. Our study also demonstrated
    that the approach following the human workflow guidance is superior to the results
    obtained by the Chain of Thought (CoT) method. In the future, we hope that our
    work will further inspire research on complex inferential writing, enabling the
    full potential of LLMs in open-ended writing tasks.

    metric, but there is still room for improvements over the accuracy of the automatic
    evaluation process. The generated results exhibit randomness and instability.

    and monolingual training corpora to generate translations of high quality. Unfortunately,
    statistical machine translation system often suffers from data sparsity problem
    due to the fact that phrase tables are extracted from the limited bilingual corpus.
    Much work has been done to address the data sparsity problem such as the pivot
    language approach (Wu and Wang,2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2007) and deep learning
    techniques (Devlin et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014; Sundermeyer et al., 2014; Liu
    et al., 2014). On the problem of how to translate one source language to many
    target languages within one model, few work has been done in statistical machine
    translation. A related work in SMT is the pivot language approach for statistical
    machine translation which uses a commonly used language as a ”bridge” to generate
    source-target translation for language pair with few training corpus. Pivot based
    statistical machine translation is crucial in machine translation for resource-poor
    language pairs, such as Spanish to Chinese. Considering the problem of translating
    one source language to many target languages, pivot based SMT approaches does
    work well given a large-scale source language to pivot language bilingual corpus
    and large-scale pivot language to target languages corpus. However, in reality,
    language pairs between English and many other target languages may not be large
    enough, and pivot-based SMT sometimes fails to handle this problem. Our approach
    handles one to many target language translation in a different way that we directly
    learn an end to multi-end translation system that does not need a pivot language
    based on the idea of neural machine translation. Neural Machine translation is
    a emerging new field in machine translation, proposed by several work recently
    (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014),
    aiming at end-to-end machine translation without phrase table extraction and language
    model training. Different from traditional statistical machine translation, neural
    machine translation encodes a variable-length source sentence with a recurrent
    neural network into a fixed-length vector representation and decodes it with another
    recurrent neural network from a fixed-length vector into variable-length target
    sentence. A typical model is the RNN encoder-decoder approach proposed by Bahdanau
    et al. (2014), which utilizes a bidirectional recurrent neural network to compress
    the source sentence information and fits the conditional probability of words
    in target languages with a recurrent manner. Moreover, soft alignment parameters
    are considered in this model. As a specific example model in this paper, we adopt
    a RNN encoder-decoder neural machine translation model for multi-task learning,
    though all neural network based model can be adapted in our framework. In the
    natural language processing field, a1724 notable work related with multi-task
    learning was proposed by Collobert et al. (2011) which shared common representation
    for input words and solve different traditional NLP tasks such as part-of-Speech
    tagging, name entity recognition and semantic role labeling within one framework,
    where the convolutional neural network model was used. Hatori et al. (2012) proposed
    to jointly train word segmentation, POS tagging and dependency parsing, which
    can also be seen as a multi-task learning approach. Similar idea has also been
    proposed by Li et al. (2014) in Chinese dependency parsing. Most of multi-task
    learning or joint training frameworks can be summarized as parameter sharing approaches
    proposed by Ando and Zhang (2005) where they jointly trained models and shared
    center parameters in NLP tasks. Researchers have also explored similar approaches
    (Sennrich et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2013) in statistical machine translation which
    are often refered as domain adaption. Our work explores the possibility of machine
    translation under the multitask framework by using the recurrent neural networks.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst trial of end to end machine translation
    under multi-task learning framework. |  | ChatCite with GPT-3.5 |'

- en: '| Related Work The field of machine translation has witnessed remarkable progress
    in addressing data scarcity and enhancing translation quality. Early approaches
    such as the pivot language approach proposed by Wu and Wang (2007) [Reference
    1], and the triangulation method introduced by Cohn and Lapata (2007) [Reference
    2], focused on improving phrase-based statistical machine translation, particularly
    for language pairs with scarce resources. Additionally, Devlin et al. (2014) [Reference
    3] contributed by introducing a neural network joint model (NNJM) for machine
    translation, offering valuable insights into the formulation of a novel neural
    network joint model and techniques for enhancing machine translation performance.
    Moreover, Gao et al. (2014) [Reference 4] enriched the understanding of addressing
    data scarcity and improving translation quality by introducing a Continuous-space
    Phrase Translation Model (CPTM) to project source and target phrases into continuous-valued
    vector representations, complementing the approaches of previous researchers.
    Furthermore, Sundermeyer et al. (2014) [Reference 5] expanded the scope of machine
    translation by investigating the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks in
    translation modeling, contributing to the broader landscape of machine translation
    research. In the context of the target paper, which proposed a multi-task learning

- en: '| Based on the given information, here is a related work section for the target
    paper: Related Work The problem of learning from multiple tasks and utilizing
    unlabeled data has been an area of significant research interest in machine learning
    and natural language processing (NLP). The concept of semi-supervised learning,
    which involves the use of both labeled and unlabeled data, has been explored in
    various studies with the aim of improving the performance of supervised learning
    algorithms. Vapnik introduced the notion of transductive inference, which is a
    form of semi-supervised learning, although its effectiveness has been debated
    (Vapnik, 1998; Zhang and Oles, 2000). Co-training, another semi-supervised approach,
    was proposed by Blum and Mitchell (1998) and is related to the bootstrap method
    used in NLP applications (Yarowsky, 1995). However, the effectiveness of co-training
    can be limited by the assumptions made by the method and the potential introduction
    of noise into the labels (Pierce and Cardie, 2001). The idea of learning predictive
    structures from multiple tasks, also known as structural learning or multi-task
    learning, has been discussed in the literature. Ando and Zhang (2005) presented
    a framework for structural learning where multiple tasks are used to discover
    a shared low-dimensional predictive structure. This approach is based on the principle
    that a good hypothesis space should have a small approximation error and a small
    estimation error. The authors proposed an algorithm for structural learning that
    finds a common low-dimensional feature space shared by multiple problems. Their
    method was shown to be effective in semi-supervised learning settings, improving
    the performance of various NLP tasks. In the context of NLP, the joint approach
    to tasks such as word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing has been
    explored. Hatori et al. (2012) proposed an incremental joint model for Chinese
    POS tagging and dependency parsing, demonstrating improvements over baseline models.
    The work by Kubota Ando and Zhang (2005) extends this idea to a joint model that
    simultaneously processes word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing,
    capturing global interactions among these tasks. Their model employs an efficient
    character-based decoding method that combines features from state-of-the-art segmentation,
    POS tagging, and dependency parsing models. The use of external resources, such
    as dictionaries, has also been considered in joint models to enhance performance.
    Wang et al. (2011) used semi-supervised methods with large auto-analyzed data
    to improve Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. The incorporation of syntactic
    information has been shown to improve the segmentation of out-of-vocabulary words,
    which is a common challenge in languages like Chinese where transliterated words
    often include characters used as common or function words. Overall, the related
    work demonstrates the potential of joint and semi-supervised approaches in leveraging
    multiple tasks and unlabeled data to improve the performance of machine learning
    models in NLP tasks. The target paper builds upon these concepts by proposing
    a unified framework that avoids task-specific engineering and learns internal
    representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data, achieving good performance
    across various NLP tasks. |  | GPT-4.0 with few shot |'

- en: '| The Unified Neural Network Model for NLP Tasks Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, chunking, named entity recognition
    (NER), and semantic role labeling (SRL) are essential for understanding and generating
    human language. Traditional approaches to these tasks often involve task-specific
    feature engineering, which can be labor-intensive and may not generalize well
    to new tasks or datasets. To address these issues, researchers have proposed unified
    neural network models that can learn to perform multiple NLP tasks simultaneously
    without extensive feature engineering. These models leverage large amounts of
    both labeled and unlabeled data to learn useful representations for words, phrases,
    and sentences that capture syntactic and semantic information. One such model
    is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which has been shown to be effective
    for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks like machine translation. LSTMs can process
    input sequences of variable lengths and learn long-range dependencies, making
    them suitable for NLP tasks. They can be trained end-to-end with backpropagation
    and can learn from both supervised and unsupervised data. Another approach is
    the use of semi-supervised learning methods, which combine labeled and unlabeled
    data to improve model performance. For example, structural learning algorithms
    can learn predictive structures from multiple tasks and use them to enhance the
    performance of individual tasks. This can be particularly useful when there is
    a large amount of unlabeled data available. The success of these unified neural
    network models demonstrates the potential of using deep learning techniques for
    NLP tasks. By avoiding task-specific engineering and leveraging large datasets,
    these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks,
    making them valuable tools for researchers and practitioners in the field of NLP."

    the domain of literature review summarization, the proposed ChatCite framework
    within our target paper represents a significant advancement, aiming to harness
    the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality related
    work summaries. The foundational work in this field began with hierarchical keyword
    structures for extractive summarization [Reference 1], and has progressed through
    various iterations including multi-source pointer-generator networks [Reference
    2], and sophisticated models like the ARWG system [Reference 3], BACO [Reference
    4], and the Relation-aware Related work Generator (RRG) [Reference 5]. The introduction
    of contrastive learning to improve summarization quality [Reference 6], and automatic
    citation sentence generation methods [Reference 7], have further refined the capabilities
    of LLMs in this space. Recent studies have concentrated on the unsupervised and
    few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs, notably GPT-3, establishing a solid groundwork
    for AI application in scholarly communication [References 8-9]. The exploration
    of AI tools such as ChatGPT by Huang, Jingshan, and Ming Tan (2023) [Reference
    10] in crafting scientific review articles, sheds light on both the potential
    benefits and drawbacks of AI in academic writing, such as enhancement in speed
    and quality versus risks of inaccuracies and bias. Building on these insights,
    the LitLLM toolkit suggested by Shubham Agarwal, Issam H. Laradji et al. (2024)
    [Reference 11] brings novel approaches to overcome challenges like the generation
    of hallucinated content and the overlooking of recent studies by employing Retrieval
    Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized prompting, and instructive
    techniques. This showcases a significant alignment with our target paper’s objectives,
    particularly in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing summarization accuracy
    through the ChatCite framework. The latest contribution in this domain is presented
    by Yang Liu, Dan Iter, et al. (2023) [Reference 12] through the G-EVAL framework,
    which introduces a methodology for evaluating the quality of texts generated by
    natural language generation (NLG) systems using LLMs, leveraging chain-of-thoughts
    (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm. This approach, which significantly outperforms
    previous methods in evaluating the creativity and diversity required in text generation
    tasks, aligns closely with the goals of the ChatCite framework, especially in
    its pursuit of generating high-quality literature summaries. The G-EVAL framework
    not only surpasses all previous state-of-the-art evaluators on the SummEval and
    Topical-Chat benchmarks but also underscores the importance of instruction sensitivity
    and the benefits of a CoT approach, which could potentially inform future enhancements
    in the ChatCite framework [Reference 12]. By evaluating the quality of NLG outputs,
    [Reference 12] addresses the limitations identified in prior works, including
    the potential bias of LLM-based evaluators towards LLM-generated texts, and calls
    for further research to understand the behavior of LLM-based evaluators fully.
    This contribution is particularly relevant to our target paper, which aims to
    enhance the quality and stability of literature review summarizations generated
    by LLMs. Thus, integrating insights from G-EVAL [Reference 12] can provide a more
    nuanced understanding of evaluating the effectiveness of automated scholarly writing
    tools, highlighting a potential area for future development within the scope of
    the ChatCite framework. In summary, the development of automated scholarly writing,
    particularly in literature review summarization, has progressed through key innovations
    in LLM capabilities, methodological enhancements, and now, through improved evaluation
    frameworks. This journey from extractive summarization to sophisticated LLM-based
    frameworks underscores a collaborative advancement in the field, with each contribution
    building upon the last to address emerging challenges and achieve greater accuracy,
    efficiency, and relevance in automated scholarly writing. The ChatCite framework,
    supported by insights from references [References 1-12], continues this trajectory
    by proposing innovative solutions to the challenges in literature review summarization,
