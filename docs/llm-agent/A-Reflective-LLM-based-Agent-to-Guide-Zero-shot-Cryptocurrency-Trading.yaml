  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial trading has primarily
    been concentrated within the stock market, aiding in economic and financial decisions.
    Yet, the unique opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency market, noted for
    its on-chain data’s transparency and the critical influence of off-chain signals
    like news, remain largely untapped by LLMs. This work aims to bridge the gap by
    developing an LLM-based trading agent, CryptoTrade, which uniquely combines the
    analysis of on-chain and off-chain data. This approach leverages the transparency
    and immutability of on-chain data, as well as the timeliness and influence of
    off-chain signals, providing a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market.
    CryptoTrade incorporates a reflective mechanism specifically engineered to refine
    its daily trading decisions by analyzing the outcomes of prior trading decisions.
    This research makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it broadens the applicability
    of LLMs to the domain of cryptocurrency trading. Secondly, it establishes a benchmark
    for cryptocurrency trading strategies. Through extensive experiments, CryptoTrade
    has demonstrated superior performance in maximizing returns compared to traditional
    trading strategies and time-series baselines across various cryptocurrencies and
    market conditions. Our code and data are available at [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CryptoTrade-Public-92FC/](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CryptoTrade-Public-92FC/).

    stock market prediction by excelling in tasks such as sentiment analysis Liang
    et al. ([2022](#bib.bib16)) and explanation generation Pu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib25)).
    Specialized models like FinGPT and BloombergGPT Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib17));
    Wu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib34)) demonstrate this capability. Recent research highlights
    their ability to interpret financial time-series and enhance cross-sequence reasoning
    Wei et al. ([2022](#bib.bib30)); Yu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib39)); Zhang et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib40)); Zhao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib41)); Yang et al. ([2024](#bib.bib36)).
    Furthermore, the development of LLM-based trading agents like Sociodojo Cheng
    and Chin ([2024](#bib.bib5)) underscores the potential for innovating investment
    strategies.

    yet this field holds great potential for future development for three main reasons.
    First, the cryptocurrency market is characterized by high market value, volatility,
    and uncertainty, which challenge traditional trading signals Drożdż et al. ([2023](#bib.bib7));
    Wei et al. ([2023](#bib.bib31)). Second, LLMs have demonstrated their ability
    to understand and analyze financial markets by leveraging large volumes of multi-modal
    data, such as news and price information Wu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib34)). Third,
    the cryptocurrency market includes open-sourced on-chain data, such as gas prices
    and total transaction values, providing insights beyond just price movements Feichtinger
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)); Ren et al. ([2023](#bib.bib26)). To bridge this gap,
    we introduce CryptoTrade. By integrating on-chain data, including market data
    and transaction records, with off-chain information like financial news, CryptoTrade
    leverages both dimensions to execute daily trading strategies, taking full advantage
    of the transparency of on-chain data and the immediacy of off-chain information.
    We detail the structure of CryptoTrade in [Figure 1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction
    ‣ A Reflective LLM-based Agent to Guide Zero-shot Cryptocurrency Trading").

    where on-chain details such as transactions and broader market data are aggregated
    alongside off-chain data from established financial news outlets like Bloomberg
    and Yahoo Finance. Following collection, we conduct statistical analyses to derive
    indicators such as moving averages and utilizing text processing for news summarization
    using GPT-3.5-turbo¹¹1[https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo).
    Finally, we enhance day-to-day decision-making with specialized analytical agents:
    market analyst agent evaluates market trends, news analyst agent interprets recent
    news impacts, and trading agent deliberates on investment actions. Concurrently,
    reflection agent reviews past performance, allowing CryptoTrade to refine its
    strategies to maximize returns.'

    and GPT-4o³³3[https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o),
    evaluating its proficiency in making daily trading decisions for Bitcoin (BTC),
    Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These three cryptocurrencies were selected for
    their prominence and market values of $134.14, $45.59, and $7.61 billion, respectively,
    as of June 2nd, 2024⁴⁴4[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/).
    CryptoTrade significantly outperforms time-series baselines such as Informer Zhou
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib42)) and PatchTST Nie et al. ([2022](#bib.bib20)), and
    achieves comparable performance to trading signals like Moving Average Convergence
    Divergence (MACD) Gencay ([1996](#bib.bib10)) in both return and sharpe ratio
    across bull, sideways, and bear market conditions. Notably, CryptoTrade operates
    in a zero-shot manner without fine-tuning based on validation sets, highlighting
    its potential for future applications. For instance, during the ETH bullish test
    period, the Buy and Hold strategy secured a 22.59% return, while CryptoTrade exceeded
    this by a remarkable 3%.

    fine-tuning, CryptoTrade outperforms Transformer-based time-series baselines in
    most bases, demonstrating the robust capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, its performance
    is comparable to traditional trading signals like Buy and Hold and MACD, further
    validating the potential of LLM-based approaches. For instance, CryptoTrade (GPT-4o)
    excels in all metrics under ETH’s bull market by 3% in total return and sharpe
    ratio. While CryptoTrade (GPT-4o) may not always be the top performer in every
    scenario, it consistently surpasses more than half of the trading signals across
    different market conditions, even without fine-tuning. This highlights the effectiveness
    and versatility of CryptoTrade in leveraging LLMs to navigate the complexities
    of the cryptocurrency market.

    significantly influenced economics and financial decision-making. Specialized
    LLMs like FinGPT, BloombergGPT, FinMA Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib17)); Wu et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib34)); Xie et al. ([2023](#bib.bib35)) are tailored for finance,
    handling tasks such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and question-answering.
    Another research direction uses LLMs for financial time-series forecasting. A
    notable contribution by Yu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib39)) employed zero-shot or few-shot
    inference with GPT-4 and instruction-based fine-tuning with LlaMA to enhance cross-sequence
    reasoning and multi-modal signal integration. Additionally, the development of
    LLM-based agents for financial trading has gained attention. Sociodojo Cheng and
    Chin ([2024](#bib.bib5)) created analytical agents for stock portfolio management,
    showing the potential for generating "hyperportfolios." Despite these advancements,
    the focus has largely been on the stock market Koa et al. ([2024](#bib.bib13));
    Chen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)), leaving a gap in the exploration of the cryptocurrency
    market where the on-chain data is approachable and with much information. Our
    work aims to address this gap by leveraging both on-chain and off-chain data to
    navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

- en: Time-Series Forecasting for Financial Markets Time-series forecasting has long
    been a cornerstone of research in economics and financial markets. Early studies
    focused on predicting stock market prices using methodologies such as machine
    learning Leung et al. ([2021](#bib.bib15)); Patel and Yalamalle ([2014](#bib.bib22)),
    reinforcement learning Lee ([2001](#bib.bib14)), and traditional time-series models
    Herwartz ([2017](#bib.bib11)). The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has emerged
    as particularly influential Sunny et al. ([2020](#bib.bib28)) for its capability
    to process and analyze time-series data. With the rise of blockchain technology
    and cryptocurrencies, these techniques have been extended to crypto assets Khedr
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib12)). Recent research has evaluated the impact of various
    predictors on cryptocurrency pricing and returns, using both on-chain data—such
    as historical transactions and market volume Ferdiansyah et al. ([2019](#bib.bib9))—and
    off-chain factors like social media trends and news sentiment Abraham et al. ([2018](#bib.bib1));
    Pang et al. ([2019](#bib.bib21)). These studies underscore the effectiveness of
    integrating diverse data sources for forecasting the volatile dynamics of the
    cryptocurrency market. Apart from above, Transformer-based models have shown particular
    promise in this area, with state-of-the-art models like Informer Zhou et al. ([2021](#bib.bib42)),
    AutoFormer Wu et al. ([2021](#bib.bib33)), PatchTST Nie et al. ([2022](#bib.bib20)),

    refine prompts Pryzant et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24)); Ye et al. ([2024](#bib.bib37))
    and provide automated feedback to enhance reasoning capabilities Paul et al. ([2023](#bib.bib23)),
    marks significant progress in the field. Notably, the "Reflexion" framework by
    Shinn et al. ([2024](#bib.bib27)) revolutionizes the reinforcement of language
    agents by utilizing linguistic feedback and reflective text within an episodic
    memory buffer, diverging from traditional weight update methods. These advancements
    highlight the potential for LLMs to learn from their errors and evolve through
    self-reflection. Despite these developments, there is still untapped potential
    in applying self-reflective language agents to financial decision-making, particularly
    in cryptocurrency markets. This work aims to bridge that gap by investigating
    the application of self-reflective mechanisms to enhance financial decision-making
    processes in cryptocurrency trading.

- en: We propose the CryptoTrade agent, an innovative approach to cryptocurrency trading
    that leverages advanced data analysis and LLMs. By integrating both on-chain and
    off-chain data, along with a self-reflective component, the CryptoTrade agent
    demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and achieves relatively
    high returns in cryptocurrency trading. Our comprehensive experiments comparing
    the CryptoTrade agent to traditional trading strategies and time-series models
    reveal its superior ability to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market, consistently
    achieving relatively high returns on investment under different market conditions.
    This research underscores the significant potential of LLM-driven strategies in
    enhancing trading performance and sets a new benchmark for cryptocurrency trading
    with LLMs.

    limited dataset. To address this, we plan to enrich the dataset with additional
    off-chain data. Another limitation is the frequency of trading actions, which
    is currently set to day-to-day. We aim to refine this to hour-to-hour or minute-to-minute
    intervals to further optimize returns in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally,
    we have identified that the lack of fine-tuning for the LLMs using the validation
    set may be a significant factor behind the LLM-based agents’ underperformance
    compared to traditional trading signals. To improve the reliability of our forecasts,
    we intend to fine-tune the LLMs with the validation set.
