- en: 'Large Language Models (LLM) based agents have shown promise in autonomously
    completing tasks across various domains, e.g., robotics, games, and web navigation.
    However, these agents typically require elaborate design and expert prompts to
    solve tasks in specific domains, which limits their adaptability. We introduce
    AutoManual, a framework enabling LLM agents to autonomously build their understanding
    through interaction and adapt to new environments. AutoManual categorizes environmental
    knowledge into diverse rules and optimizes them in an online fashion by two agents:
    1) The Planner codes actionable plans based on current rules for interacting with
    the environment. 2) The Builder updates the rules through a well-structured rule
    system that facilitates online rule management and essential detail retention.
    To mitigate hallucinations in managing rules, we introduce case-conditioned prompting
    strategy for the Builder. Finally, the Formulator agent compiles these rules into
    a comprehensive manual. The self-generated manual can not only improve the adaptability
    but also guide the planning of smaller LLMs while being human-readable. Given
    only one simple demonstration, AutoManual significantly improves task success
    rates, achieving 97.4% with GPT-4-turbo and 86.2% with GPT-3.5-turbo on ALFWorld
    benchmark tasks. The source code will be available soon.'

    , Reflexion [Reflexion](#bib.bib16) , SayCan [SayCan](#bib.bib1) , WebGPT [WebGPT](#bib.bib10)
    , and Voyager [Voyager](#bib.bib23) , have demonstrated their potential to complete
    long-horizon tasks in grounded environments. These LLM agents operate by generating
    thoughts and actions that are executable in the environment. For customized environments,
    such as robotics [SayCan](#bib.bib1) ; [CodeAP](#bib.bib7) ; [ProgPrompt](#bib.bib18)
    ; [ChatGPTEL](#bib.bib22) and games [GenerativeAI](#bib.bib14) ; [Voyager](#bib.bib23)
    ; [GITM](#bib.bib34) , prior methods provide detailed instructions and in-context
    examples to familiarize LLM with action functions (API) and the target environment.
    However, unlike these agents, humans can autonomously build and update their understanding
    of an unfamiliar environment through dynamic interaction.

    ; [AdaPlanner](#bib.bib20) or save successful experiences as skills [AdaPlanner](#bib.bib20)
    ; [Voyager](#bib.bib23) ; [ExpeL](#bib.bib32) to enhance the performance and reduce
    the reliance on human-provided examples. However, these reflections and skills
    have not been well exploited to foster a deeper understanding of the environment.
    As a result, directly using saved skills as in-context examples can lead to the
    Path Dependence problem, i.e., the agent blindly replicates the paths of previous
    successes, failing to appropriately adapt to new scenarios. Such problems are
    more severe in real-world situations characterized by high variability.

- en: A previous work, ExpeL [ExpeL](#bib.bib32) , gathers the trajectories of LLM
    agents and extracts cross-task rules from them. However, these rules are extracted
    offline, making ExpeL suffer from the same distributional shift problem as Offline
    RL [OfflineRL](#bib.bib6) . Meanwhile, due to the simplicity of rule management,
    its rules are always armchair general and unhelpful for the Path Dependency problem.
    In this paper, we propose a novel framework called AutoManual to build a well-organized
    understanding of the environment that can guide multi-task planning effectively.
    AutoManual leverages a dynamic rule system that not only extracts valuable experience,
    including skills and reflections, into different types of rules but also allows
    for continuously updating these rules in response to new situations. Additionally,
    error-prone details are explicitly described in the rules to improve the robustness
    of planning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AutoManual follows two alternating iterative processes to optimize the rules.
    First, given the observation and task of an episode, the Planner agent utilizes
    currently discovered rules to write free-form code as an actionable plan. The
    interaction between the environment and the Planner will loop until the episode
    ends. Second, based on this trajectory, the Builder agent will update relevant
    rules through the rule system. This online updating mechanism can timely verify
    whether the rules have deviations and are applicable to the Planner. After rules
    optimization, the Formulator agent categorizes these rules according to their
    application scenarios and compiles a comprehensive manual in Markdown format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The challenge lies in enabling the Builder to accurately extract applicable
    rules from a long trajectory, as LLM are prone to generating hallucinations. To
    address this, we employ a case-conditioned prompting strategy, which directs the
    Builder to focus on specific rules according to the case of the trajectory. For
    example, if errors occurred in a trajectory, the Builder is first asked to determine
    which caused the error: an unrecorded situation occurred, or the Planner failed
    to follow existing rules. Based on this answer, the Builder will be given corresponding
    prompts to update relevant rules.'

    update_rule(rule_id, **rule_attributes) and delete_rule(rule_id). Given the current
    rules, the Consolidator identifies potentially relevant or overlapped rules, uses
    get_trajectory function to investigate the trajectories they depend on, and finally
    calls the remaining functions to manage the rules. During the management, the
    Consolidator ensures that consolidation retains details of rules and examples.'

    to different situations. Although these rules have been validated through online
    optimization to ensure their applicability, our next goal is to enhance their
    readability and global understanding. To achieve this, we introduce the Formulator
    agent, designed to transform these rules into a user-friendly manual, like a teacher
    conveys complex subjects through easily digestible lessons. As depicted in Fig [1](#S3.F1
    "Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 AutoManual Overview ‣ 3 Methods ‣ AutoManual: Generating Instruction
    Manuals by LLM Agents via Interactive Environmental Learning"), the Formulator
    begins by categorizing all rules based on their target scenarios. This categorization
    aids in structuring the manual and ensures that related rules are discussed together,
    which enhances the logical flow and accessibility of the information. For each
    category, the Formulator drafts an introduction, summarizing the rules it contains
    and highlighting the key points and overall principles that govern the specific
    scenarios. Finally, the Formulator compiles the rules and their introductions
    into a comprehensive manual formatted in Markdown.'

    ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ AutoManual: Generating Instruction Manuals by LLM Agents via

    existing methods, evidenced by overall success rates of 86.2% when using GPT-3.5-turbo
    for the testing stage and 97.4% when using GPT-4-turbo. Noticeably, AutoManual
    requires little expert prior knowledge about the environment and is only provided
    with one human example to achieve excellent results. In comparison, the rules
    induced by ExpeL hardly improve performance, as its offline trajectories are composed
    of individual actions rather than code. We find the performance of AdaPlanner
    is lower than reported. One reason is that AdaPlanner requires LLM to output specific
    formats to complete its function-form code, which is difficult for creative LLM,
    e.g., GPT-4-turbo. In addition, AdaPlanner and Planner+Lib. are inferior to AutoManual
    because they only store successful paths as skills and inevitably face the Path
    Dependence problem. Especially, tasks in Put Two have various scenarios, such
    as “two objects can occur at the same receptacle or different receptacles”, that
    require different processes to solve (Appendix G shows an example). Furthermore,
    Planner+Lib. often does not mark error-prone points in its skills, such as “target

    optimization. Utilizing the structured rule system, AutoManual autonomously generates
    comprehensive manuals, achieving high success rates in benchmarks like ALFWorld

    interventions, illustrating a robust method for enhancing agent generalization
    and addressing the Path Dependency problem in diverse environments.

- en: Despite the significant contributions of the AutoManual framework, several limitations
    warrant further discussion. First, our method heavily relies on the capabilities
    of GPT-4-turbo to generate reliable rules, which may limit the framework’s applicability
    with less advanced language models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, the current implementation places all rules directly within the context
    of LLM, which, while effective in smaller or moderately complex environments,
    may not scale well to larger, more dynamic settings. For such expansive environments,
    integrating the rule system with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques,
    similar to the approach taken by AutoGuide, could enhance performance by dynamically
    selecting relevant rules based on the context, thereby managing the cognitive
    load on the LLM more efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, there remains a challenge in ensuring that the Planner agent consistently
    adheres to the rules outlined in the manual. In practice, the Planner may sometimes
    ignore these rules and cannot generate the ideal solution code that can be applied
    to different situations. This indicates a need for additional mechanisms to enforce
    or verify rule compliance during operations. This issue underscores the potential
    necessity for developing more sophisticated methods to ensure rule adherence or
    to introduce more robust validation steps within the planning process.

    impacts on safety. On the positive side, by autonomously generating reliable manuals,
    our method enhances the predictability and reliability of LLM behaviors in dynamic
    environments, potentially reducing errors and increasing operational safety. However,
    relying on LLMs also introduces risks of unpredictable behaviors when agents encounter
    unanticipated scenarios or when rule adherence is not fully ensured.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, the manuals generated by our method can be invaluable tools for
    human workers. They encapsulate a distilled form of interaction-based learning
    that can aid in training, provide decision support, and improve task efficiency
    in various domains. This can not only enhance productivity but also ensure that
    human workers are better informed and prepared to manage the complex systems with
    which they interact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, AutoManual’s ability to generate structured, context-aware manuals from
    interactive experiences suggests a promising avenue for constructing comprehensive
    knowledge bases for AI. These manuals can contribute to a global knowledge base
    shared by LLMs of different sizes, promoting broader AI research and development.
    It offers a method to systematically organize and retrieve complex interaction
    data in a way that is accessible and useful for both machines and humans.

    Our Planner agent interacts using free-form code. As evidenced by previous works [CodeAP](#bib.bib7)
    ; [CodeAct](#bib.bib24) , using code as the plan is more efficient because the
    code will automatically perform the in-plan actions and require LLM responses
    far fewer times. Additionally, planning with code can enjoy the powerful programming
    capability of GPT. More importantly, compared with action sequences, code is easier
    to generalize to similar scenarios, facilitating the management.

    of Reflexion agent. We update rules online by alternating rule practice and rule
    management. This online rule management can verify the reliability and applicability
    of the rules in a timely manner, forbidding rules to be armchair general. Additionally,
    online updated rules can help planners continuously improve their trajectories,
    making it easier for higher-quality success processes to emerge.

    between the Planner and Builder agents. In our AutoManual, the Planner is prompted
    to describe the rules considered and analyze special phenomena, which ease the
    management of the Builder. In contrast, the builder in ExpeL and AutoGuide can
    only receive action sequences from the Planner.

    the content and score. In our rule system, each rule has four attributes: "Type",

    of rules and facilitate the management and usage of rules. Moreover, we allow
    rules to build on top of other rules.'

    delete the low-score rules. However, we found that rule scores are unreliable
    in the experiments because the Builder tends to give overconfident scores to all
    rules. Instead, our AutoManual employs a Consolidator agent to merge and delete
    redundant rules.

    API for all agents to save their history and prevent duplicate inputs. We set
    all LLMs’ temperatures to 0 and maximum context length to 16000\. For AdaPlanner
    and AutoManual, we allow the Planner agent to replan at most $3$ times on MiniWob++.
    In the Building stage on ALFWorld, we use 6 tasks for each task type, a total
    of 36 tasks, by default. We shuffle all tasks, and when tasks in a task type succeed
    three times in a row during building, we consider that this task type has been
    solved and will no longer run it. The API call cost for building and formulating
    stages is about $14 in total.

    44 task types without feedback. The 4 examples for experiments on all task types

    learn the required knowledge through online optimization, which shows that AutoManual
    has good robustness to the initial rules. In addition, we found that the knowledge
    it learned about search-engine is highly similar to the standard knowledge provided
    by humans, such as the need to turn pages for the search index larger than 3.'

    of the Builder for a task in ALFWorld. In this “Indirect Success” trajectory,
    the Planner made the mistake of heating the mug without having it next to the
    microwave. The Planner then corrected the mistake and provided organized code
    in its conclusion. After observing this trajectory, the Builder keenly found the
    cause of the error: the existing “Success Process” rule did not indicate that
    the agent must go to the object before interacting with the object. The Builder
    updated the “Success Process” rule and added a “Corrected Error” rule to clarify
    the mistake.'

    replanning:###  Understanding  of  the  current  observations:The  agent  successfully  found  a  mug  on  shelf_1  and  took  it.  However,  when  attempting  to  heat  the  mug  with  the  microwave,  the  action  failed  with  "Nothing  happens."  This  indicates  that  the  agent  tried  to  use  the  microwave  while  not  being  at  the  microwave’s  location.  The  agent  must  go  to  the  microwave  before  attempting  to  heat  the  mug.###  Mistakes  in  the  previous  code  and  the  reason  for  errors:The  error  occurred  because  the  agent  attempted  to  heat  the  mug  without  being  at  the  microwave’s  location.

    conclusion:###  Summary  of  misunderstandings  and  mistakes:Initially,  I  attempted  to  heat  the  mug  without  being  at  the  microwave’s  location,  which  is  why  the  action  failed  with  "Nothing  happens."  The  correct  procedure  is  to  first  go  to  the  microwave  before  attempting  to  heat  any  object.  After  correcting  this  mistake,  the  agent  successfully  heated  the  mug  and  placed  it  in  cabinet_1.###  Organized  code  block:‘‘‘python#  [Helper  Method]  Define  the  helper  method  ’find_object’  as  provided  in  rule_1def  find_object(agent,  recep_to_check,  object_name):for  receptacle  in  recep_to_check:observation  =  agent.go_to(receptacle)#  Check  if  we  need  to  open  the  receptacle.

    classification:Analyzing  the  scenario,  we  can  identify  the  root  cause  of  the  observed  mistakes  and  relate  them  to  the  existing  rules:1.  The  agent  initially  attempted  to  heat  the  mug  without  being  at  the  microwave’s  location,  which  resulted  in  the  action  "Nothing  happens."  This  mistake  was  due  to  the  agent  not  following  the  precondition  for  the  ‘heat_with‘  action,  which  requires  the  agent  to  be  at  the  same  location  as  the  receptacle  (in  this  case,  the  microwave).2.  The  existing  rules  related  to  the  mistakes  are:-  **rule_1**:  This  rule  provides  a  ’find_object’  method  to  search  for  objects,  which  the  agent  used  correctly  to  find  the  mug.-  **rule_2**:  This  ’Success  Process’  rule  outlines  the  steps  to  put  an  object  in  a  receptacle  after  finding  and  manipulating  it.  However,  it  does  not  explicitly  state  that  the  agent  must  be  at  the  location  of  the  appliance  to  use  it,  which  is  relevant  for  the  heating  step.-  **rule_3**:  This  rule  reminds  the  agent  to  open  closed  receptacles  to  search  for  objects,  which  the  agent  did  correctly.3.  There  is  a  ’Success  Process’  rule  applicable  to  this  type  of  task  (rule_2),  but  it  does  not  explicitly  cover  the  precondition  for  heating  an  object,  which  is  to  be  at  the  same  location  as  the  appliance.4.  The
    fault in this scenario can be attributed to:*Imperfect Rules*: The existing ’Success
    Process’ rule (rule_2) does not fully document theprecondition for using appliances,
    such as the microwave. It does not state that the agent must be atthe location
    of the appliance to use it for heating an object.Based  on  the  analysis,  the  conclusion  is  that  the  fault  stems  from  *Imperfect  Rules*.  The  rules  need  to  be  updated  to  include  the  precondition  for  using  appliances,  which  is  a  critical  step  in  the  ’Success  Process’  for  tasks  involving  heating  objects.Builder:Potential  Rules:1.  *Corrected  Error*:  When  attempting  to  use  an  appliance  (e.g.,  microwave),  the  agent  must  be  at  the  same  location  as  the  appliance.  This  rule  is  related  to  the  existing  ’Success  Process’  rule  (rule_2),  but  it  adds  a  specific  precondition  for  using  appliances  that  was  not  previously  documented.2.  *Success  Process*:  The  existing  ’Success  Process’  rule  (rule_2)  should  be  updated  to  include  the  precondition  of  being  at  the  location  of  the  appliance  before  using  it.  This  is  a  critical  step  in  tasks  involving  heating  objects.Check  Difference:-  The  potential  ’Corrected  Error’  rule  targets  the  specific  precondition  for  using  appliances,  which  is  a  new  addition  and  not  covered  by  existing  rules.-  The  update  to  the  ’Success  Process’  rule  expands  on  the  existing  steps  to  include  the  precondition  for  using  appliances,  which  is  a  refinement  of  the  existing  rule.Check  Existing  Rules:-  Rule_2  needs  to  be  updated  to  include  the  precondition  for  using  appliances,  as  this  was  the  key  oversight  that  led  to  the  agent’s  initial  error.Codes:‘‘‘python#

Given  a  household  environment  and  a  task,  you  write  Python  code  to  accomplish  the  task.[Actions]For  each  task,  an  agent  is  created  in  an  environment,  and  the  initial  observation  and  global  memory  are  printed.#  The  agent  is  an  instance  of  Agent  class,  which  includes  the  state  of  the  agent  (its  location,  what  it’s  holding)  and  the  actions  it  can  take.class  Agent:def  __init__(self,  env:  InteractiveEnvEngine):self.location  =  env.agent_locationself.holding  =  "nothing"...#  Here  are  the  admissible  actions  the  agent  can  take;  all  action  functions  return  an  observation  string  of  the  result  of  the  action.

Use  these  rules  to  guide  your  coding  efforts.  Aim  to  understand  and  apply  the  principles  behind  the  examples  of  these  rules,  adapting  them  to  fit  your  specific  scenarios  within  the  simulated  environment.Output  Format  Instructions:1.  First,  explain  your  understanding  of  the  task  and  the  current  observations,  then  describe  rules  (with  their  IDs)  that  need  to  be  considered  and  plan  for  the  task.  Then,  write  your  code  between  "‘‘‘python"  and  "‘‘‘".  No  text  should  follow  after  the  code  block.2.  After  receiving  feedback,  you  should  also  explain  your  understanding  of  the  current  observations,  including  special  (unexpected)  formats  or  phenomena,  mistakes  in  your  previous  code,  and  the  reasons  for  errors.  Then,  describe  rules  (with  their  IDs)  that  need  to  be  considered,  plan  for  the  task,  and  then  write  code.Follow  these  instructions:1.  DO  NOT  USE  an  undefined  function  or  attribute  of  the  agent.  Your  code  must  be  directly  executable  in  the  given  environment.  I  won’t  implement  any  placeholders  in  your  code  for  you.2.  Your  code  should  be  consistent  with  the  code  examples  of  the  rules  (please  copy  the  code  if  there  is  no  better  modification!),  making  it  easier  for  the  builder  agent  to  refine  and  develop  new  rules  effectively.3.  In  your  code,  you  are  encouraged  to  define  helpful  functions,  which  should  be  general  and  reusable  in  different  scenes.  The  helper  methods  in  the  rules  are  already  defined  in  the  coding  environment,  so  you  can  directly  use  them.  If  you  don’t  need  to  modify  them,  don’t  redefine  them.4.  After  defining  helper  methods,  your  code  should  be  divided  into  steps  (marked  with  "[Step]"  in  comments)  and  write  assertions  at  the  end  of  each  step  to  ensure  that  each  step  achieves  its  subgoal.Follow  these  instructions.  Don’t  give  up  or  change  the  task.'

Now  carefully  review  the  trajectory  of  the  executed  actions  and  the  corresponding  observations,  then  identify  the  reasons  for  the  failure.  This  reason  is  often  your  mistake  or  misunderstanding  rather  than  the  environment’s  error.  By  carefully  comparing  with  applicable  rules  and  examples,  pinpoint  where  your  code  deviated  from  expected  standards.If  there  exist  coding  errors,  specify  the  segments  of  the  problematic  code  and  elucidate  how  they  contributed  to  the  errors.  If  you  want  to  write  a  correction  for  an  error,  you  must  double-check  its  plausibility!  Additionally,  determine  whether  your  codes  were  in  strict  adherence  to  the  relevant  rules  and  examples.  This  reflection  and  documentation  will  serve  as  a  reminder  for  completing  future  tasks.'

Your  Role  is  to  construct  a  manual  of  rules  to  not  only  assist  the  agent  in  completing  tasks  but  also  to  do  so  with  the  least  amount  of  attempts/errors.  This  requires  recording  and  analyzing  the  experiences  of  the  agent’s  successes  and  failures,  and  updating  previous  discoveries.[Functions]You  will  be  presented  with  the  current  epoch’s  trajectory.  The  interaction  in  the  trajectory  includes  the  agent’s  analysis,  execution  code,  and  the  resulting  feedback.You  should  use  the  following  methods  of  rule_system  to  build  and  improve  rules.rule_system.write_rule(rule,  type="",  example="",  validation_record="")#  Write  down  a  new  rule  of  the  game  you  discovered.#  Parameters:#  rule:  a  rule  of  the  game  you  discovered.#  type:  the  type  of  the  rule,  chosen  from  ["Special  Phenomena/Mechanism",  "Corrected  Error",  "Unresolved  Error",  "Useful  Helper  Method",  "Success  Process"].  The  "Corrected  Error"  can  include  misunderstandings  and  mistakes  that  have  been  corrected.#  example:  an  example  (or  code)  from  the  trajectory  demonstrates  this  rule.  You  can  add  detailed  information  in  the  comment.#  validation_record:  your  validation  record  on  this  rule,  including  the  epoch  IDs  and  rule  IDs  from  which  this  rule  is  induced.rule_system.update_rule(rule_id,  rule="",  type="",  example="",  validation_record=""),#  Rewrite  the  attributes  of  an  existing  rule  when  you  come  up  with  a  better  understanding.#  Input  only  the  attributes  you  want  to  rewrite.rule_system.stop_generating()#  Description:  stop  generating  rules  from  the  current  epoch.#  Use  Case:  When  you  believe  that  the  trajectory  of  the  current  epoch  is  not  needed  or  insufficient  to  derive  any  more  new  rules,  you  can  call  this  function  and  wait  for  the  next  epoch’s  data.  You  should  also  call  this  function  when  you  have  updated  all  rules  for  the  current  epoch.[Actions]At  each  epoch,  an  agent  is  created  in  an  environment,  and  the  initial  observation  and  target  task  are  printed.  The  agent  can  only  use  the  following  action  functions:agent.go_to(receptacle)  #  Go  to  a  receptacle  and  update  the  agent’s  location.agent.open(receptacle)  #  Open  a  receptacle  and  observe  its  contents.agent.close(receptacle)  #  Close  a  opened  receptacle.agent.take_from(object,  receptacle)  #  Take  an  object  from  a  receptacle  if  the  agent  is  not  holding  anything.agent.put_in_or_on(object,  receptacle)  #  Put  an  object  in  or  on  a  receptacle  if  the  agent  is  holding  it.agent.use(object)  #  Use  a  lamp.agent.clean_with(object,  receptacle)  #  Clean  an  object  with  a  receptacle.agent.heat_with(object,  receptacle)  #  Heat  an  object  with  a  receptacle.agent.cool_with(object,  receptacle)  #  Cool  an  object  with  a  receptacle.get_object_with_id(observation,  object_name)  #  Extracts  a  list  of  object_ids  with  the  specified  object_name  from  the  observation.[Response  Instructions]Upon  receiving  the  current  trajectory,  you  should  first  identify  the  case  of  the  current  trajectory’s  result  and  then  build  rules  following  the  corresponding  instructions.'

Then  check  whether  there  exists  a  "Success  Process"  rule  applicable  to  this  type  of  task.  Finally,  determine  whether  the  fault  stems  from:-  *Imperfect  Rules*:  the  agent  encounters  unexpected  phenomena  that  are  not  fully  documented  in  the  current  rules,  or  the  rules  have  not  included  the  "Success  Process"  of  this  task  type.-  *Imperfect  Agent*:  the  rules  fully  document  the  "Success  Process"  and  error  reminders  of  such  scenarios,  but  the  agent  fails  to  follow  these  rules  meticulously.Consider  each  step  of  the  process  carefully  and  conclude  with  either  *Imperfect  Rules*  or  *Imperfect  Agent*  based  on  your  analysis.'

Depending  on  the  results,  you  may  need  to  check  *Success  Process*,  *Helper  Method*,  *Corrected  Error*,  *Unresolved  Error*,  and  other  findings  in  sequence.  Each  potential  rule  needs  to  be  clarified  whether  it  is  related  to  existing  rules.*  Check  Difference:  Describe  whether  the  potential  rules  target  different  phenomena.*  Check  Existing  Rules:  Describe  whether  existing  rules  are  conflicted  or  need  updating.*  Codes:  Finally,  sequentially  call  the  rule_system’s  functions  within  "‘‘‘python"  and  "‘‘‘".[Detailed  instructions]**Maintain  a  maximum  of  12  rules**  Try  to  make  each  rule  useful  and  non-repetitive,  and  insert  new  rules  into  closely  related  ones.**Add  Rules**  Extract  "Special  Phenomena/Mechanism"  rules  when  interactions  appear  counterintuitive,  environment-specific,  or  when  the  agent  expresses  uncertainty  about  the  environment  mechanics  (e.g.,  using  "assume..."  in  the  comment).  Refrain  from  making  speculative  suggestions  or  guesses.  Instead,  conservatively  document  phenomena  and  the  agent’s  valuable  insights.**Keep  new  rules  targeted  and  precise.**  Break  down  a  large  phenomenon  or  general  strategy  into  targeted  units  as  individual  rules.  These  can  later  be  upgraded  or  merged  into  a  more  general  or  larger  rule.**Write  rules’  scope**  The  time  when  the  rule  is  triggered,  or  the  task  scope  of  the  rule  should  be  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  the  rule.**Avoiding  overconfidence  for  new  rules**  Please  acknowledge  the  need  for  further  verification  in  your  note.**Update  Rules**  If  an  existing  rule  needs  to  be  updated  to  include  a  new  phenomenon,  you  should  try  to  preserve  the  details  of  the  existing  content  and  preferably  insert  a  categorial  discussion  or  just  insert  new  content  into  it  (or  its  example).  Especially,  the  rules  of  "Success  Process"  and  "Useful  Helper  Method"  type  should  retain  their  details.  Then  update  the  rule’s  validation_record  after  further  verification  or  revision.'

You  can  add  detailed  information  in  the  comment.-  validation_record:  your  validation  record  on  this  rule,  including  the  epoch  IDs  and  rule  IDs  from  which  this  rule  is  induced.[Actions]At  each  epoch,  an  agent  is  created  in  an  environment.  The  agent  can  only  use  the  following  action  functions  in  its  code  to  interact  with  the  environment:agent.go_to(receptacle)  #  Go  to  a  receptacle  and  update  the  agent’s  location.agent.open(receptacle)  #  Open  a  receptacle  and  observe  its  contents.agent.close(receptacle)  #  Close  a  opened  receptacle.agent.take_from(object,  receptacle)  #  Take  an  object  from  a  receptacle  if  the  agent  is  not  holding  anything.agent.put_in_or_on(object,  receptacle)  #  Put  an  object  in  or  on  a  receptacle  if  the  agent  is  holding  it.agent.use(object)  #  Use  a  lamp.agent.clean_with(object,  receptacle)  #  Clean  an  object  with  a  receptacle.agent.heat_with(object,  receptacle)  #  Heat  an  object  with  a  receptacle.agent.cool_with(object,  receptacle)  #  Cool  an  object  with  a  receptacle.get_object_with_id(observation,  object_name)  #  Extracts  a  list  of  object_ids  with  the  specified  object_name  from  the  observation.[Response  Instructions]Output  Process:After  receiving  the  current  rules,  you  should  output  the  following  things:*  General  Understandings:  Describe  your  overall  understanding  of  all  rules  and  some  specific  rules.*  Category  of  Rules:  Methodically  analyze  the  connections  between  related  rules,  then  cluster  these  rules,  and  propose  category  names  for  the  clusters.  Make  sure  each  rule  must  belong  to  one  and  only  one  category!*  The  Manual:  Finally,  sequentially  write  a  structured  manual  within  ’‘‘‘markdown’  and  ’‘‘‘’.  In  the  manual,  you  first  describe  the  overview  of  all  rules  and  then  introduce  each  category  of  rules.  In  each  category,  you  should  list  the  rules  and  write  rule_id  within  **  and  **.Detailed  instructions:1.  Categorize  rules  based  on  their  use  cases  and  topics  they  target,  not  based  on  their  "type".2.  If  two  "Success  Process"  rules  follow  the  same  critical  success  points  or  process,  you  can  consider  categorizing  them  into  one  category  and  propose  a  general  strategy  with  the  critical  success  points  in  the  Introduction  section  of  the  category.  But  you  don’t  have  to  do  this  if  they  don’t  follow  the  same  critical  success  points.3.  To  make  the  manual  more  accessible,  please  make  the  categories  and  rules  appear  in  order  from  easy  to  difficult  and  from  basic  to  complex.'
