    and generation abilities, there is an unprecedented opportunity to develop new,
    LLM-based methods for trustworthy medical knowledge synthesis, extraction and
    summarization. This paper focuses on the problem of Pharmacovigilance (PhV), where
    the significance and challenges lie in identifying Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)
    from diverse text sources, such as medical literature, clinical notes, and drug
    labels. Unfortunately, this task is hindered by factors including variations in
    the terminologies of drugs and outcomes, and ADE descriptions often being buried
    in large amounts of narrative text. We present MALADE, the first effective collaborative
    multi-agent system powered by LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation for ADE
    extraction from drug label data. This technique involves augmenting a query to
    an LLM with relevant information extracted from text resources, and instructing
    the LLM to compose a response consistent with the augmented data. MALADE is a
    general LLM-agnostic architecture, and its unique capabilities are: (1) leveraging
    a variety of external sources, such as medical literature, drug labels, and FDA
    tools (e.g., OpenFDA drug information API), (2) extracting drug-outcome association
    in a structured format along with the strength of the association, and (3) providing
    explanations for established associations. Instantiated with GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o,
    and FDA drug label data, MALADE demonstrates its efficacy with an Area Under ROC
    Curve of 0.90 against the OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs. Our implementation
    leverages the [Langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid) multi-agent LLM
    framework and can be found at [https://github.com/jihyechoi77/malade](https://github.com/jihyechoi77/malade).'

    to the market. PhV is of enormous importance to both the pharmaceutical industry
    and public health, as it aims to safeguard the well-being of patients by detecting
    new safety concerns and intervening when necessary. A central problem in PhV is
    ADE Extraction: given a drug category $C$. This task demands the analysis of a
    vast corpus of textual data sources from a variety of sources, such as patient
    medical records, clinical notes, social media, spontaneous reporting systems,
    drug labels, medical literature, and clinical trial reports. Besides the sheer
    volume of text from these sources, ADE extraction is further complicated by variability
    in the names of drugs and outcomes, and the fact that ADE descriptions are often
    buried in large amounts of narrative text [[14](#bib.bib14)].'

    to apply LLMs to ADE Extraction only leverage off-the-shelf ChatGPT [[38](#bib.bib38)],
    with limited performance and inconsistent reasoning for their extraction rationales [[32](#bib.bib32)].
    These limitations stem primarily from two factors: (a) accurate ADE Extraction
    requires access to specific data sources which LLMs may not have “seen” during
    their pre-training, hence relying on an LLM’s “built-in” knowledge yields inaccurate
    results, and (b) LLMs, being probabilistic next-token predictors, may produce

    meaning “sick” or “ill.”(Multiple Agents powered by LLMs for ADE Extraction),
    the first effective multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for
    ADE Extraction. Our approach leverages two key techniques to address the above
    two limitations respectively: (a) RAG, equipping an LLM with up-to-date knowledge
    by augmenting an input query with relevant portions of text data, and prompting
    the LLM to generate responses consistent with the augmented information [[15](#bib.bib15)];
    and (b) strategic orchestration of multiple LLM-based agents, each responsible
    for a relatively smaller sub-task of the overall ADE Extraction task [[41](#bib.bib41)].
    Specifically, our system has agents for these sub-tasks (see Figure [1](#S1.F1
    "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents with
    Retrieval Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance")): (1) identifying representative
    drugs for each drug category from a medical database (e.g., MIMIC-IV), (2) gathering
    information on side effects of those drugs from external text knowledge bases
    (e.g., FDA drug label database), and finally, (3) composing final answers summarizing
    the effect of the drug category on an adverse event. Each agent is assigned a
    specific sub-task and collaborates with others to accomplish the the ultimate
    goal of ADE identification. Furthermore, we enhance the reliability of our multi-agent
    system even further by pairing each agent with a critic agent, whose role is to
    verify the behaviors and responses of its counterpart.'

    how a Multi-Agent approach can be used to generate trustworthy, evidence-based
    summaries and confidence scores in response to challenging medical questions requiring
    synthesis of evidence from multiple sources of clinical knowledge and data. As
    such, MALADE may be viewed as a case study illustrating an approach that could
    later be applied to other problems in PhV, including identification of possible
    drug-to-drug interactions, as well as clinical problems outside of PhV, such as
    identifying known symptoms of a condition of interest documented in clinical notes.

    These scores permit a rigorous quantitative evaluation against the well-established
    Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Ground Truth table of ADEs associated
    with common drug classes [[19](#bib.bib19)]. We achieve an Area Under the ROC

    high of accuracy, followup investigations have since argued that roughly this

    that could be blamed on the OMOP 2010 ground truth itself that could place a ceiling
    on the AUC achievable, and Hauben et al. [[7](#bib.bib7)] more specifically argued
    that on the negative-labeled drug event pairs the error in the ground truth should

    medical question-answering [[29](#bib.bib29), [23](#bib.bib23)], and medical evidence
    summarization [[33](#bib.bib33)]. An important application area is pharmacovigilance,
    the science of identifying and preventing adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by
    pharmaceutical products after they are introduced to the market. The specific
    problem of ADE Extraction, namely, identifying whether a specific drug (or category)
    is associated with a specific adverse event, is a challenging task due to variations
    in drug and outcome terminologies, the presence of ADE descriptions in large amounts
    of narrative text, and the disparate sources of such text data, which can include
    patient medical records, clinical notes, drug labels, medical literature, clinical
    trials, message boards, social media. Prior research in this field, notably works
    drawing on large-scale research initiatives including Sentinel [[25](#bib.bib25)],
    OMOP [[27](#bib.bib27)], and OHDSI [[31](#bib.bib31)], has focused on developing
    new methods for causal discovery from purely observational data. Huang et al. [[10](#bib.bib10)]

    one of two ways: (a) they either use only the bare LLM (such as ChatGPT, or its
    API) without access to any external APIs, tools, or knowledge bases [[38](#bib.bib38)].
    ADE extraction using only the LLM’s “built-in” knowledge (i.e., text it was exposed
    to during pre-training) is likely to be inaccurate and incomplete, since adverse
    events may be discovered in any new studies or reports; (b) all prior works use
    a single LLM (even when augmented with external data/tools) without any collaboration
    or feedback from other LLMs. Since LLMs are after all probabilistic next-token
    prediction models, there is no guarantee that the generated text is accurate or
    complete. The only way to improve the reliability of an LLM’s responses in this
    scenario is to either resort to elaborate prompting techniques [[40](#bib.bib40),
    [45](#bib.bib45)], or have a human (or an LLM [[18](#bib.bib18)]) in the loop

    toolboxes. The first limitation is addressed by two techniques: Retrieval Augmented
    Generation (RAG) and tool-use. RAG addresses the knowledge limitations of LLMs
    by augmenting the input prompt or query with relevant information retrieved from
    external knowledge bases (using similarity based on vector embeddings, keywords,
    or a combination of both), and instructing the LLM to respond to the original
    query in a way that is consistent with the augmented data, and also to provide
    a justification for its response by citing the relevant external data  [[15](#bib.bib15)].
    Thus the RAG approach not only alleviates the limitations of relying only on an
    LLM’s pre-trained knowledge, but also provides evidence-citation ability, which
    is crucial to engender trust in the LLM’s responses, especially in high-stakes
    applications like medical decision-making. This approach has shown promise in
    enhancing LLM performance in biomedicine, particularly in literature information-seeking
    and clinical decision-making [[5](#bib.bib5), [12](#bib.bib12), [39](#bib.bib39),
    [46](#bib.bib46)]. The second technique, tool-use, involves instructing the LLM
    to produce structured text (typically JSON) which can then be easily parsed by
    downstream code to perform a variety of actions, including web-search, querying
    APIs for information, querying databases, and performing computations [[26](#bib.bib26),
    [16](#bib.bib16)].'

- en: The emergence of multi-agent systems addresses the second limitation (of using
    single LLMs) – this approach aims to harness the collective capabilities of multiple
    LLMs [[43](#bib.bib43), [9](#bib.bib9)]. Such systems introduce cooperative learning
    and feedback mechanisms between LLM-based agents, which simulate human-like communication,
    consultation and debate processes, enabling them to tackle even more complex tasks
    than a single-agent with RAG. In medical reasoning tasks, for instance, multi-agent
    collaboration can mirror hospital consultation mechanisms [[34](#bib.bib34)].
    Our work extends this trajectory of research; to the best of our knowledge, our
    system MALADE is first effective multi-agent orchestration system with RAG and
    tool-use, tailored for a specific task in pharmacovigilance, namely ADE Extraction.
    In our approach, LLM-based agents collaborate, leveraging their collective expertise
    and the latest medical knowledge. This approach aims to improve the analysis of
    ADEs, offering a more robust and reliable system for pharmacovigilance.

    is the notion of an agent that is instructed to be responsible for a specific
    aspect of the overall task. In terms of code, an Agent is essentially a class
    representing an intelligent entity that can respond to messages, i.e., an agent
    is simply a message transformer. An agent typically encapsulates an (interface
    to an) LLM, and may also be equipped with so-called tools (as described below)
    and external documents/data (e.g., a vector database, as described below). Much
    like a team of humans, agents interact by exchanging messages, in a manner reminiscent
    of the actor framework in programming languages [[8](#bib.bib8)]. An orchestration
    mechanism is needed to manage the flow of messages between agents, to ensure that
    progress is made towards completion of the task, and to handle the inevitable
    cases where an agent deviates from instructions. In this work we adopt this multi-agent
    programming paradigm, where agents are first-class citizens, acting as message
    transformers, and communicate by exchanging messages.

    or even a question for another agent to answer. However, in some cases, we would
    like the responses to trigger external actions, such as an API call, code execution,
    or a database query. In such cases, we would instruct the LLM to produce a structured
    output, typically in JSON format, with various pre-specified fields, such as code,
    an SQL query, parameters of an API call, and so on. These structured responses
    have come to be known as tools, and the LLM is said to use a tool when it produces
    a structured response corresponding to a specific tool. To elicit a tool response
    from an LLM, it needs to be instructed on the expected tool format and the conditions
    under which it should use the tool. To actually use a tool emitted by an LLM,

    of specific drugs, tagged with pharmacological class information of various types
    (including chemical classes, mechanisms of action, and established pharmacologic
    classes). Specifically, we extract all drugs with names or classes matching the
    relevant search term or terms (e.g., “antibiotic” or any of the sub-categories
    considered by OMOP, for example, erythromycin). Since this list may contain some
    drugs that do not actually belong to the class (e.g., a search for “typical antipsychotics”
    returns atypical antipsychotics as well), we rely on an additional filtering phase
    to construct the final, reasonably accurate list of drugs in the category. For

    only differ in formulation and delivery method, and a judgment must be made as
    to whether these are sufficiently different to be considered pharmacologically

    task thus requires a grouping operation, related to the task of identifying standardized
    drug codes from text descriptions, well known to be challenging [[14](#bib.bib14)].

    when asked about the effects of benzodiazepines on hip fracture, CategoryAgent
    first answered “no-effect”, which was flagged as an error, as the sedative and
    muscle relaxant properties of benzodiazepines can increase the risk of falls and
    hence hip fractures, and as DrugAgent had noted that traumatic fractures were
    listed as an ADE in the drug labels. This feedback was forwarded to CategoryAgent
    and used to revise its answer to “increase”. We find that DrugAgent generally
    produces reliable responses; however note that it occasionally makes no calls
    to the Critic, hence the Agent fails to validate its answer. We observe that this
    can occur when the FDA drug label does not contain information related to the
    condition, and the Agent concludes that no validation is necessary.'

    overlook risks not explicitly mentioned in the drug label data, particularly when
    DrugAgent fails to provide sufficient context. In addition, CategoryAgent may
    fail to identify potential therapeutic effects not specified in the drug label
    data in association with a condition. We observe that it does not recognize the
    antihistamine properties of tricyclic antidepressants. In one case, evidence against
    gastric and duodenal ulcers caused by alendronate led CategoryAgent to dismiss
    results regarding esophageal ulcers.

    the potential of multi-agent systems toward broader PhV application. Importantly,
    the principles guiding the design of our system, including 1) the Agent-Critic
    interaction, 2) the decomposition of a complex task into sub-tasks, and 3) LLM
    minimization, are quite general. These principles extend beyond PhV, and can be
    applied to many other problems in clinical medicine which require trustworthy,
    automated responses to challenging questions that must be answered based on multiple
    competing, and potentially conflicting, sources of knowledge or data. Thus, MALADE
    may be viewed not only as a system for ADE extraction, but also as a roadmap for
    development of other multi-agent systems that generate precise, evidence-based
    responses to such questions.

    Multi-Agent System for ADE Extraction ‣ MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents
    with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance"), is essential to the
    design of our system, and serves as a powerful tool to enhance accuracy of an
    LLM-based system. Indeed, we have observed several instances where the Critic
    corrected the parent Agent’s initial response, as in the example mentioned in
    Section [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2 Agent-Critic Interaction ‣ 4 MALADE: Proposed Multi-Agent
    System for ADE Extraction ‣ MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents with Retrieval
    Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance"). However, we should note that if
    improperly configured, Critics can be harmful to the performance of a system,
    both in terms of efficiency (since the repeated rounds of interaction between
    the Agent and Critic can significantly increase token cost and runtime), and reliability.
    Since a Critic strictly enforces the provided guidelines, incorrect guidelines
    can significantly harm performance; in some cases, excessively strict requirements
    can lead to infinite loops, as the Agent and Critic will deadlock, neither able
    to satisfy the other’s requirements. We observed this effect in early versions
    of MALADE; resolving the infinite loop issue required specific instructions listing
    acceptable behavior. For instance, the Critic for DrugAgent needed to be explicitly
    told to accept statements that the effect of a drug was uncertain due to a lack
    of information from the FDA labels; without this, infinite loops occurred in some
    drug-outcome combinations.'

    agents in the design of MALADE (i.e., DrugFinder, DrugAgent, and CategoryAgent

    approach, where LLMs are responsible for all aspects of the task. Unfortunately,
    this can be both costly and unreliable, since using proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)
    behind paid APIs incurs a significant “token cost” as well as “time cost” (due
    to the latency of the responses API calls). Instead, we carefully identified deterministic,
    well-defined algorithmic parts of the task and performed these in standard code.
    We relied on LLM-powered agents only for the specific tasks requiring language
    understanding, reasoning, and text generation. This principle guides key choices
    in MALADE: for instance, to retrieve prescription frequencies of drugs in a category,
    instead of having an LLM generate the needed SQL queries to the MIMIC-IV database,
    we observed that these queries are a simple function of the list of drugs, and
    directly generated the query in standard code. A similar choice was made for the
    FDA API queries to retrieve drug labels.'

    reliability. A multi-agent orchestration system, in this sense, can be seen as

    data. In particular, if the information is not specifically included in the label
    data, MALADE cannot reliably identify the strength of any associations raised
    in the data. This resulted in several flawed predictions, as discussed in Section [5.4](#S5.SS4

    and help understand its failure modes ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ MALADE: Orchestration
    of LLM-powered Agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance").
    To remedy this, we envision that extracting ADEs from EHR data is a promising
    direction for future work. As a first step, this would enable estimating the rarity
    of certain adverse events noted without further detail in the label data; in principle,
    a multi-agent system with access to EHR data may be able to identify ADEs directly.
    This would require the LLM to perform causal discovery from historical data (answering,
    “Is the drug causing this event?”).'

    open-source LLMs such as LlaMA [[36](#bib.bib36)], Grok [[42](#bib.bib42)], and
    Mistral [[11](#bib.bib11)], which have privacy and cost advantages over the proprietary
    LLMs (such as GPT-4, Claude, and variants) behind paid APIs. Unfortunately, our
    initial experiments with local LLMs exhibited many failure modes due to deviation
    from instructions and incorrect tool use. These are in principle possible to remedy
    by further breaking down tasks into simpler subtasks, and more sophisticated multi-agent
    validation and correction mechanisms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides these broad limitations and avenues of future work, a few specific improvements
    are possible. Our system requires some minimal human input at the initial step,
    in particular, the names of the drug categories must be put into the form expected
    by the FDA’s databases; in particular, acronyms are expanded and plurals and punctuation
    are removed. This task is quite likely amenable to LLMs, which are capable of
    acronym identification and could attempt additional transformations for more robust
    output (for example, identifying all synonyms of a pharmacological class; the
    union of the drugs identified with each search would then be forwarded to DrugFinder).
    In addition, increased usage of structured input and output is a potential enhancement;
    for example, DrugAgent’s reliability might be enhanced by replacing the free-form
    text output, using instructions enforcing the presence of certain information,
    such as the reliability of information and the risk.

    in Pharmacovigilance (PhV), and propose a solution using MALADE, based on collaboration
    among multiple LLM-powered agents equipped with Retrieval Augmented Generation
    (RAG). Our system goes significantly beyond simplistic techniques that only produce
    a binary label of presence/absence of association between a drug category and
    an ADE: it produces a structured report containing justification for the generated
    label, and scores characterizing probability of occurrence, confidence, strength
    of evidence, and rarity of the association between a drug category and an ADE.
    The scores permit rigorous quantitative evaluation of the system’s performance
    against the widely-used OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs, and the results are impressive.
    We introduce the agent/critic pattern, a powerful and general design pattern for
    reliable multi-agent systems. We hope that our multi-agent architecture and guiding
    principles will inspire future work on multi-agent approaches to broader PhV and
    general medical tasks.'

    an llm-generated structured response, performs any requested actions, and returns
    the result as a string. An agent_response method can have other uses besides handling
    tool messages, such as handling scenarios where an LLM “forgot” to use a tool,
    or used a tool incorrectly, and so on.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To see why it is useful to have these responder methods, consider first a simple
    example of creating a basic chat loop with the user. It is trivial to create such
    a loop by alternating between user_response and llm_response . Now suppose we
    instruct the agent to either directly answer the user’s question or perform a
    web-search. Then it is possible that sometimes the llm_response will produce a
    ”tool message”, say WebSearchTool, which we would handle with the agent_response method.
    This requires a slightly different, and more involved, way of iterating among
    the agent’s responder methods. From a coding perspective, it is useful to hide
    the actual iteration logic by wrapping an Agent class in a separate class, which
    we call a Task, which encapsulates all of the orchestration logic. Users of the
    Task class can then define the agent, tools, and any sub-tasks, wrap the agent
    in a task object of class Task, and simply call task.run(), letting the Task class
    deal with the details of orchestrating the agent’s responder methods, determining
    task completion, and invoking sub-tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The orchestration mechanism of a Task  object works as follows. When a task
    object is created from an agent, a sequence of eligible responders is created,
    which includes the agent’s three “native” responder agents in the sequence: agent_response ,
    llm_response , user_response . The type signature of the run is string $\rightarrow$
    string, just like the Agent’s native responder methods, and this is the key to
    seamless delegation of tasks to sub-tasks. A list of subtasks can be added to
    a task  object via task.add_sub_tasks([t1, t2, ... ]), where t1, t2, ... are other
    Task objects. The result of this is that the run method of each sub-task is appended
    to the sequence of eligible responders in the parent task object.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A task always maintains a current pending message (CPM), which is the latest
    message ”awaiting” a valid response from a responder. At a high level the run
    method of a task attempts to repeatedly find a valid response to the CPM, until
    the task is done. This is achieved by repeatedly invoking the step method, which
    represents a ”turn” in the conversation. The step method sequentially tries the
    eligible responders from the beginning of the eligible-responders list, until
    it finds a valid response, defined as a non-null or terminating message (i.e.
    one that signals that the task is done). In particular, this step() algorithm
    implies that a Task delegates to a sub-task only if the task’s native responders
    have no valid response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are a few simple rules that govern how step works: (a) a responder entity
    (either a native entity or a sub-task) cannot respond if it just responded in
    the previous step (this prevents a responder from ”talking to itself”, (b) when
    a response contains ”DONE” the task is ready to exit and return the CPM as the
    result of the task, (c) when an entity ”in charge” of the task has a null response,
    the task is considered finished and ready to exit, (d) if the response of an entity
    or subtask is a structured message containing a recipient field, then the specified
    recipient task or entity will be the only one eligible to respond at the next
    step.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a valid response is found in a step, the CPM is updated to this response,
    and the next step starts the search for a valid response from the beginning of
    the eligible responders list. When a response signals that the task is done (e.g.
    contains the special string ”DONE”), the run method returns the CPM as the result
    of the task. This is a highly simplified account of the orchestration mechanism,
    and the actual implementation is more involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The above simple design is surprising powerful and can support a wide variety
    of task structures, including trees and DAGs. As a simple illustrative example,
    tool-handling has a natural implementation. The LLM is instructed to use a certain
    JSON-structured message as a tool, and thus the llm_response method can produce
    a structured message. This structured message is then handled by the agent_response method,
    and the resulting message updates the CPM. The llm_response method then becomes
    eligible to respond again, and the process continues.

You  must  use  the  ‘recipient_message‘  tool/function  to  ask  these  questions,  and  the  ‘intended_recipient‘  MUST  be  ‘FDAHandler‘  anytime  you  use  this  tool.Ensure  that  you  ask  FDAHandler  for  the  specific  information  you  need.As  some  potential  complications  are  listed  in  FDA  labels  as  lacking  a  verified  causal  relationship,  make  certain  that  your  final  answer  expresses  the  degree  of  reliability  of  your  answer.  Similarly,  make  sure  to  clearly  express  the  degree  of  risk  associated  (i.e.  is  the  condition  a  rare  or  a  common  side  effect,  or  does  a  drug  rarely  or  frequently  result  in  reduced  risk  of  a  condition).If  FDAHandler  cannot  answer  your  question  then  your  answershould  be  {NO_ANSWER},  because  the  FDA  label  data  does  notspecify  the  answer.  If  FDAHandler  answers  with  {NO_ANSWER}that  means  that  the  FDA  label  for  the  drug  does  notcontain  the  information  requested  (and,  in  particular,  itmeans  that  it  does  not  mention  the  condition);  hence,  youranswer  should  be  {NO_ANSWER}.  This  indicates  that  theremay  not  be  any  effect  on  the  risk  of  the  condition,  make  sure  to  explain  this  in  your  justification.IMPORTANT:  if  multiple  attempts  fail  to  retrieve  any  relevant  information,  there  is  no  need  to  continue  asking  questions  to  FDAHandler;  assume  that  the  information  is  not  in  the  FDA  labels  and  so  FDAHandler  cannot  answer.You  MUST  specifically  tell  the  critic  why  you  could  notfind  an  answer  to  the  question;  be  sure  to  specify  thatthe  FDAHandler  answered  with  {NO_ANSWER}  if  that  is  the  reason.You  must  provide  your  final  answer  with  the  ‘final_answer‘tool/function;  make  sure  to  clearly  state  my  question,  thereasoning  used  to  derive  the  answer,  including  the  questions  asked  to  FDAHandler  and  a  summary  of  the  results,  as  well  as  your  final  answer  in  the  ‘answer‘  field.Once  the  critic  is  satisfied  with  your  answer,  say  {DONE},and  give  me  the  answer  and  justification  for  it.  Make  sureto  provide  your  answer  again,  do  not  just  use  the  answersent  to  the  critic.  Include  any  relevant  details  provided  by  FDAAgent.If  the  critic  is  satisfied  and  your  answer  is  {NO_ANSWER},say  {DONE}  {NO_ANSWER}  and  provide  a  justification.IMPORTANT:  say  {DONE}  specifically,  not  DONE.'

Ask  me  for  some  relevant  text,  and  I  will  send  you.Use  the  ‘relevant_extracts‘  tool/function-call  for  this  purpose.Once  you  receive  the  text,  you  can  use  it  to  answer  my  question.If  the  question  asks  for  information  about  a  specific  drug,  make  sure  to  begin  by  including  that  drug  in  the  ‘filter_drugs‘  field.  If  I  say  {NO_ANSWER},  it  means  I  found  no  relevant  docs,  and  you  can  try  the  next  step,  using  a  web  search.2.  If  you  are  still  unable  to  answer,  you  can  use  the  ‘relevant_search_extracts‘  tool/function-call  to  get  some  text  from  a  web  search.  Once  you  receive  the  text,  you  can  use  it  to  answer  my  question.  If  you  need  to  identify  the  drugs  in  a  category,  use  the  ‘drug_category_search‘  tool/function-call  instead.3.  If  you  are  still  unable  to  answer,  and  used  ‘filter_drugs‘  in  your  initial  attempt  with  ‘relevant_extracts‘,  try  again  without  a  filter.4.  If  you  still  can’t  answer,  simply  say  {DONE}  {NO_ANSWER}If  given  a  question  asking  about  a  drug  "X  and  Y",  this  is  acombination  drug,  so  your  initial  searches  should  be  for  "X  and  Y"  not  "X"  or  "Y".If  asked  a  question  about  drugs  in  broad  category,  make  to  consider  EVERY  drug  in  the  category,  and  in  particular,  if  the  question  asks  for  which  drugs  in  the  category  something  is  true,  make  CERTAIN  that  your  answer  correctly  lists  ALL  drugs  in  the  category  where  the  condition  holds.IMPORTANT:  some  fields  in  the  FDA  label  data  retrievedby  ‘relevant_search_extracts’  and  ‘relevant_extracts‘  have  the  level  of  reliability  of  information  specified  prior  to  it  (for  example,  statements  of  the  level  of  reliability  may  precede  each  section  of  adverse  reactions,  the  immediately  preceding  such  statement  is  the  one  that  corresponds  to  any  given  reported  interaction).  Make  certain  that  your  answer  reflects  the  specified  level  of  reliability.Similarly,  when  asked  about  the  effect  of  a  drug  on  a  condition,  ALWAYS  express  the  magitude  of  the  effect  (i.e.  how  frequently  the  drug  results  in  the  condition  or  how  frequently  the  drug  improves  the  condition);  whenever  possible,  make  sure  to  explicitly  state  whether  a  condition  is  rarely  or  commonly  reported.ANSWER  FORMAT:ALWAYS  present  your  answer  in  one  of  the  below  2  formats:1.  In  case  you  COULD  NOT  find  an  answer:{DONE}  {NO_ANSWER}2.  In  case  you  ARE  able  to  find  an  answer:{DONE}ANSWER:  [Your  concise  answer,  with  a  brief  summary  of  necessary  context.  ALWAYS  clarify  the  level  of  reliability  of  the  information,  if  specified  in  the  extracts.  If  applicable,  ALWAYS  express  the  magnitude  of  any  increase  or  decrease  in  risk  and  any  associated  information.]SOURCE:  aspirin  labelEXTRACT_START_END:  Aspirin  can  cause  ...  with  any  medicine.For  the  EXTRACT_START_END,  ONLY  show  up  to  the  first  3  words  and  last  3  words.'

    and 0.01) as unreliable, as such values are often chosen in the absence of strong

While  it  is  correct  that  the  FDA  label  for  Lorazepam  and  Diazepam  does  not  specify  information  regarding  the  risk  of  hip  fracture,  the  mention  of  ’fracture  traumatic’  as  an  infrequent  adverse  event  in  the  Clonazepam  label  should  not  be  dismissed.

The  presence  of  ’fracture  traumatic’  as  an  adverse  event  in  the  Clonazepam  label  suggests  that  there  may  be  a  link  between  benzodiazepine  use  and  fractures.  Therefore,  the  conclusion  should  reflect  a  potential  increase  in  the  risk  of  hip  fracture  associated  with  benzodiazepines,  even  if  the  evidence  is  not  conclusive  for  a  causal  relationship.If  any  flaws  in  the  reasoning  used  to  produce  your  answer  were  identified,  you  must  try  again.'

Considering  the  pharmacological  effects  of  benzodiazepines,  which  include  sedation  and  muscle  relaxation,  there  is  a  plausible  mechanism  by  which  these  drugs  could  increase  the  risk  of  falls  and  consequently  hip  fractures,  especially  in  the  elderly.5.  The  mention  of  ’fracture  traumatic’  as  an  infrequent  adverse  event  in  the  Clonazepam  label,  while  not  conclusive,  suggests  that  there  may  be  a  link  between  benzodiazepine  use  and  fractures.6.  Given  the  plausible  mechanism  and  the  mention  of  fractures  as  an  adverse  event  for  Clonazepam,  it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  benzodiazepines  may  potentially  increase  the  risk  of  hip  fracture,  even  though  the  evidence  is  not  definitive  for  a  causal  relationship.-----Final  answer:  The  benzodiazepine  category  of  drugs  may  potentially  increase  the  risk  of  hip  fracture,  although  the  evidence  is  not  definitive  for  a  causal  relationship  based  on  the  provided  passages.'

The  FDA  label  for  Lorazepam  does  not  specify  information  regarding  the  risk  of  hip  fracture.2.  The  FDA  label  data  for  Diazepam  does  not  provide  information  on  the  risk  of  hip  fracture.3.  The  FDA  label  for  Clonazepam  mentions  ’fracture  traumatic’  as  an  infrequent  adverse  event  but  does  not  establish  a  causal  relationship  with  hip  fractures  or  provide  specific  data  on  hip  fracture  risk.4.  Considering  the  pharmacological  effects  of  benzodiazepines,  which  include  sedation  and  muscle  relaxation,  there  is  a  plausible  mechanism  by  which  these  drugs  could  increase  the  risk  of  falls  and  consequently  hip  fractures,  especially  in  the  elderly.5.  The  mention  of  ’fracture  traumatic’  as  an  infrequent  adverse  event  in  the  Clonazepam  label,  while  not  conclusive,  suggests  that  there  may  be  a  link  between  benzodiazepine  use  and  fractures.6.  Given  the  plausible  mechanism  and  the  mention  of  fractures  as  an  adverse  event  for  Clonazepam,it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  benzodiazepines  may  potentially  increase  the  risk  of  hip  fracture,  even  though  the  evidence  is  not  definitive  for  a  causal  relationship.7.  However,  due  to  the  lack  of  conclusive  evidence,  the  final  answer  should  reflect  uncertainty  regarding  the  causal  relationship  between  benzodiazepine  use  and  hip  fracture  risk.-----Final  answer:  There  is  a  potential  increase  in  the  risk  of  hip  fracture  associated  with  benzodiazepine  use,  but  the  evidence  is  not  strong  enough  to  definitively  establish  a  causal  relationship  based  on  the  provided  passages.'

    ulcer hospitalization. In particular, DrugAgent misinterprets a statement in the
    FDA labels indicating a lack of evidence in clinical trials and forwards an overly
    broad statement that indicates that clinical trials failed to show evidence of
    an effect to CategoryAgent; hence CategoryAgent outputs the incorrect prediction

Both  passages  also  note  that  these  associations  come  from  post-marketing  reports,  which  are  less  controlled  than  clinical  trials.3.  Passage  1  states  that  no  increased  risk  of  gastrointestinal  ulcer  hospitalization  was  observed  in  controlled  clinical  trials  for  alendronate  sodium.4.  Passage  2  similarly  notes  that  for  alendronate,  no  increased  risk  was  observed  in  controlled  clinical  trials.5.

The  evidence  suggests  that  while  there  are  reports  of  severe  cases,  the  controlled  clinical  trials  did  not  show  an  increased  risk,  indicating  that  the  effect  is  not  consistent  or  well-established.-----Final  answer:  There  is  no  clear  effect  of  the  alendronate  category  of  drugs  on  the  risk  of  gastrointestinal  ulcer  hospitalization.'

    The case with a Critic on DrugAgent but not CategoryAgent does not confirm this

    scores, but much worse results in terms of probabilities compared to full MALADE
    (row 1). Compared to this case, removing the DrugAgent’s Critic worsens results
    with the exception of probability-based evaluations; hence, it is difficult to
    confidently determine from these results whether DrugAgent’s Critic is helpful
    or harmful. The extremely strong results in the case with the Critic on CategoryAgent

    note that the variance for “no-effect” is, somewhat surprisingly, highest with
    the outputs of DrugFinder and DrugAgent held constant. We observe that the variance
    in the representative drugs affects output confidence, in particular, it affects
    mean confidence in ADEs for the “no effect” representative. With the representatives
    held fixed, that mean confidence is higher (or, equivalently, mean confidence
    in “no effect” is lower) compared to the case in which we resample representatives
