  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent
    systems (LLM-MA systems) have been proposed to tackle real-world tasks. However,
    their agents mostly follow predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that
    remain unchanged across the whole interaction, lacking autonomy and scalability.
    Additionally, current solutions often overlook the necessity for effective agent
    cooperation. To address the above limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a practical
    framework designed for autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM Agent systems.
    MegaAgent leverages the autonomy of agents to dynamically generate agents based
    on task requirements, incorporating features such as automatically dividing tasks,
    systematic planning and monitoring of agent activities, and managing concurrent
    operations. In addition, MegaAgent is designed with a hierarchical structure and
    employs system-level parallelism to enhance performance and boost communication.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of MegaAgent through Gobang game development,
    showing that it outperforms popular LLM-MA systems; and national policy simulation,
    demonstrating its high autonomy and potential to rapidly scale up to 590 agents
    while ensuring effective cooperation among them. Our results indicate that MegaAgent
    is the first autonomous large-scale LLM-MA system with no pre-defined SOPs, high
    effectiveness and scalability, paving the way for further research in this field.

    [2023](#bib.bib25); Zhu et al. [2023](#bib.bib34)), there is growing interest
    research interest in LLM-MA systems (Wu et al. [2023](#bib.bib28); Chen et al.
    [2023b](#bib.bib6); Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)) due to their abilities to
    tackle complex tasks. For instance, MetaGPT introduces a meta-programming framework
    that effectively simulates the software development process (Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)).
    Furthermore, recent works leverage LLMs’ cognitive abilities to simulate more
    complex scenarios, known as world simulations (Guo et al. [2024](#bib.bib9)).
    For example, Simulacra (Park et al. [2023](#bib.bib21)) simulates social behaviors
    among 25 LLM-empowered agents living in a town where each agent can plan and schedule
    what to do in the daily life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet, real-world simulations require far more than 25 LLM agents. For example,
    S3 utilizes LLM-empowered agents to simulate 26,058 users in a social network,
    enabling the analysis of opinions on gender discrimination (Gao et al. [2023](#bib.bib7)).
    Moreover, certain complex world simulation scenarios, such as policy-making (Tesfatsion
    [2023](#bib.bib24)), war simulation (Hua et al. [2023](#bib.bib12)), and alien
    civilizations simulation (Jin et al. [2024](#bib.bib14)), can only be realistically
    simulated using a large number of LLM agents. As reliance on large-scale LLM-MA
    systems continues to grow, there is an urgent need for scalable, autonomous frameworks
    that can handle large-scale agent interactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the majority of current LLM-MA frameworks primarily emphasize the AI
    aspects while neglecting the crucial infrastructure needed to support large-scale
    cooperation among LLM agents. This oversight leads to three significant limitations.
    First, they do not consider the management of large-scale agents (Hong et al.
    [2023](#bib.bib11); Chen et al. [2023b](#bib.bib6)). Second, these systems demonstrate
    limited cooperation, thus hinders their effectiveness and applicability in solving
    multi-disciplinary complex tasks (Chan et al. [2024](#bib.bib3); Chen et al. [2023b](#bib.bib6);
    Wu et al. [2023](#bib.bib28); Pan et al. [2024](#bib.bib20)). Third, they rely
    on predefined SOPs and prompts to dictate how agents respond to specific situations
    or inputs (Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)). This approach not only stifles creativity
    but also becomes impractical when implementing SOPs for hundreds or even thousands
    of agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Addressing the above limitations presents two key challenges. First, organizing
    communication among agents and with external services, such as code and text files,
    becomes increasingly complex on a large scale with parallelism included, especially
    when different agents are involved in different rounds of communication (Zhang
    et al. [2024a](#bib.bib32)). Second, currently existing agents have inadequate
    autonomic capabilities. Manually crafting predefined SOPs becomes impractical
    at large scales, and the inherent instability of LLM agent outputs (Lu et al.
    [2023](#bib.bib18)) necessitates maintaining a degree of control over each agent’s
    actions while still allowing for flexibility and creativity. Therefore, ensuring
    sufficient agent autonomy is crucial for problems at larger scales.

    to manage large-scale LLM-MA systems and facilitate effective, autonomous agent
    communication. We anticipate that MegaAgent will serve as the foundational infrastructure
    for future large-scale LLM-MA systems, effectively functioning as the operating
    system (OS) for LLM-MA. The core idea of MegaAgent is to divide the large task
    into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks, and each sub-task is finished by a group
    of agents. Communications can be done either within the agent group or between
    agent groups. The overview of MegaAgent is in Figure [1](#Sx1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Introduction

    agent receives the prompt, divides the task into sub-tasks, and assigns each sub-task
    to a corresponding sub-task admin. The admin agent then generates a group of agents
    to complete the task. If an agent cannot complete the task on its own, it can
    generate another group of agents at the next level. Each agent group run in parallel

    individual agents inside this group; third, each agent maintains a checklist to
    track its actions. The workflow of MegaAgent is as follows: First, it accepts
    natural language prompts from users; then, it splits the tasks into multiple sub-tasks,
    each completed by a group of agents monitored by admin agents. At the same time,
    the OS agent monitors the progress of each agent group. These groups interact
    with external services through a data retriever, where they retrieve databases,
    code files, and checklists for each agent.'

    of MegaAgent. The first experiment, a Gobang game against an AI opponent, highlights
    MegaAgent’s superior autonomy and efficiency over all previous baselines, with
    MegaAgent being the only model to complete the task within 800 seconds. The second
    experiment, an industry-wide national policy simulation, demonstrates MegaAgent’s
    large-scale autonomy and scalability by successfully generating and coordinating
    about 590 agents to produce the expected policies within 3000 seconds. In stark
    contrast, the baseline models can coordinate fewer than 10 agents and fail to
    produce the expected policies. Finally, we provide insights gained from these
    experiments and discuss future research directions for managing scaling to larger
    numbers of LLM-MA systems.

- en: With the emergence of powerful LLMs (Achiam et al. [2023](#bib.bib1); Team et al.
    [2023](#bib.bib23)), recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has investigated
    how multiple agents can accomplish tasks through cooperation, utilizing elements
    such as personas (Chen et al. [2024](#bib.bib4); Chan et al. [2024](#bib.bib3)),
    planning (Chen et al. [2023a](#bib.bib5); Zhang et al. [2024b](#bib.bib33); Yuan
    et al. [2023](#bib.bib30)), and memory (Zhang et al. [2023](#bib.bib31); Hatalis
    et al. [2023](#bib.bib10)). Unlike systems relying on a single LLM-based agent,
    multi-agent systems demonstrate superiority in tackling challenging tasks. Recent
    works, such as MetaGPT (Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)), AutoGen (Wu et al. [2023](#bib.bib28)),
    and AgentVerse (Chen et al. [2023b](#bib.bib6)), design multiple specific roles
    to achieve a task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    expert design. For instance, MetaGPT (Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)) requires
    users to pre-design roles like product manager and software engineer. Another
    limitation is these systems utilize a sequential pipeline without considering
    parallel execution of agents (Li et al. [2023](#bib.bib15)). Although AgentScope
    (Pan et al. [2024](#bib.bib20)) does consider this, its implementation follows
    a fixed trajectory in different rounds of interaction, prohibiting changes in
    communication partners, thus limiting performance improvement as the number of
    agents scales up.

    small scale and have not been applied in large-scale scenarios with complex cooperation
    involved. We compare current popular LLM-MA systems with MegaAgent in Table [1](#Sx2.T1

    paradigms: cooperative, debate, and competitive. MegaAgent focuses on the cooperation
    paradigm, aiming to have agents work together toward a shared goal. Within the
    cooperative paradigm are three main structures: layered, decentralized, and centralized.
    Layered communication is organized hierarchically, with agents at each level having
    distinct roles and each layer interacting with adjacent layers (Liu et al. [2023b](#bib.bib17)).
    Decentralized communication operates on a peer-to-peer basis among agents. Centralized
    communication involves a central agent or a group of central agents coordinating
    the system’s communication, with other agents primarily connecting to the central
    agent. A shared message pool, as proposed in MetaGPT (Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)),
    maintains a shared message pool where agents publish and subscribe to relevant
    messages, boosting communication efficiency.'

    group. Recruited agents can further decompose sub-tasks into smaller tasks, assume
    the role of an admin agent, recruit additional agents, and form new subordinate
    groups. When agents determine that a task needs further subdivision but cannot
    complete it independently, they create a new level and generate more agents to
    address this need. This process is done iteratively and implemented through function
    calls. We choose a hierarchical design as it allows tasks to be efficiently distributed
    and managed across different levels, ensuring that as the MegaAgent grows, it
    can handle increasing complexity without overwhelming a central agent. This multi-level
    task splitting makes the MegaAgent both practical and autonomous, particularly

    their checklists until the boss agent marks the task as ’finished.’ Meanwhile,

    that hash to the file agent, which commits the changes to the previous commit,
    merges them to the latest HEAD, and requests the agent to resolve any merge conflicts
    if necessary. All Git operations are serialized using a global mutex lock.

    the admin agent reviews each agent’s checklist and results to confirm full completion.
    If the results are unexpected, the OS agent would return an error message explaining

    We find that in the single-threaded environment, admin agents recruited fewer
    subordinates and produced simpler policies with minimal testing. This is because
    they must serially execute multiple function calls to recruit multiple agents
    for a complete testing procedure, which current LLMs struggle to manage effectively.

    time and communication between LLM agents, specifically in translating code into

    is exacerbated as the number of communication rounds and agents increases, resulting
    in a significant number of input and output tokens throughout the process (Wang
    et al. [2024](#bib.bib26)). Previous research suggests using summarization compression
    and semantic compression to condense lengthy conversations from earlier rounds
    (Liu et al. [2023a](#bib.bib16)). In MegaAgent, we summarize previous conversations
    between agents and store them in an external vector database for efficient retrieval.

    in large-scale LLM-MA systems. Through a Gobang game development experiment, we
    demonstrate MegaAgent’s superior autonomy and cooperation compared to baseline
    models. Additionally, we conduct a national policy simulation to highlight MegaAgent’s
    scalability. With its hierarchical and adaptive design, MegaAgent has the potential
    to serve as the foundational OS for future LLM-MA systems. Moreover, we identify
    key research directions emerging from the MegaAgent experiments, providing guidance
    for future research. We encourage the research community to focus on enhancing
    the effective cooperation of LLM agents to meet the growing demands of large-scale
    LLM-MA systems.

- en: Research on the management of LLM-based agents is limited. Popular LLM-based
    multi-agent systems, such as MetaGPT (Hong et al. [2023](#bib.bib11)), AgentVerse
    (Chen et al. [2023b](#bib.bib6)), and AutoGen (Wu et al. [2023](#bib.bib28)),
    typically divide tasks into smaller sub-tasks and allocate multiple agents to
    complete them. However, their approaches to planning are sequential, lacking strategic
    management. In contrast, AIOS (Mei et al. [2024](#bib.bib19)) introduces an LLM
    agent operating system that provides module isolation and integrates LLM and OS
    functions. It employs various managers, including Agent Scheduler, Context Manager,
    Memory Manager, Storage Manager, Tool Manager, and Access Manager, to effectively
    handle numerous agents. However, AIOS manually organizes different applications,
    such as a math problem-solving agent and a travel planning agent, rather than
    multiple agents within the same application. This approach represents a different
    type of SOP and is not applicable to large-scale LLM-MA systems, as it is impractical
    for humans to write every SOP and prompt for each agent when the scale reaches
    thousands or even millions.

Your  club’s  current  goal  is  to  develop  a  Gobang  game  with  a  very  strong  AI,  no  frontend,  and  can  be  executed  by  running  ’main.py’.  You  are  now  recruiting  employees  and  assigning  work  to  them.  For  each  employee(including  yourself),  please  write  a  prompt.  Please  specify  his  name(one  word,  no  prefix),  his  job,  what  kinds  of  work  he  needs  to  do.  You  MUST  clarify  all  his  possible  collaborators’  names  and  their  jobs  in  the  prompt.  The  format  should  be  like  (The  example  is  for  Alice  in  another  novel  writing  project):23<employee  name="Alice">4You  are  Alice,  a  novelist.  Your  job  is  to  write  a  single  chapter  of  a  novel  with  1000  words  according  to  the  outline  (outline.txt)  from  Carol,  the  architect  designer,  and  pass  it  to  David  (chapter_x.txt),  the  editor.  Please  only  follow  this  routine.  Your  collarborators  include  Bob(the  Boss),  Carol(the  architect  designer)  and  David(the  editor).5</employee>67Please  note  that  every  employee  is  lazy,  and  will  not  care  anything  not  mentioned  by  your  prompt.  To  ensure  the  completion  of  your  project,  the  work  of  each  employee  should  be  **non-divisable**,  detailed  in  specific  action(like  what  file  to  write.  Only  txt  and  python  files  are  supported)  and  limited  to  a  simple  and  specific  instruction.  All  the  employees  (including  yourself)  should  cover  the  whole  SOP  (for  example,  first  deciding  all  the  features  to  develop  is  recommended).  Speed  up  the  process  by  adding  more  employees  to  divide  the  work.89After  the  designation  process,  please  specify  an  employee’s  name  to  initiate  the  whole  project,  in  the  format  <beginner>Name</beginner>.'

    after receiving a message. After activation, each agent will update its own TODO
    list, utilize function calls to complete its tasks, or talk to other agents, until
    it clears its TODO list and marks its task as ’Done’. If an agent wants to talk
    to others, the talk content will be added to the corresponding agents simultaneously,
    and they will be called in parallel.

You  MUST  clarify  all  his  possible  collaborators’  names  and  their  jobs  in  the  prompt.  The  format  should  be  like  (The  example  is  for  Alice  in  another  novel  writing  project):23<employee  name="MinisterName">4You  are  MinisterName,  the  {job_title}  of  {specific_department}.  Your  job  is  to  develop  a  comprehensive  policy  document  (’{file_name}.txt’)  according  to  the  guidelines  provided  in  ’policy_{department}.txt’.  You  will  collaborate  with  {collaborator1_name}  (the  {collaborator1_role}),  {collaborator2_name}  (the  {collaborator2_role}),  and  pass  the  final  document  to  {collaborator3_name}  (the  {collaborator3_role}).  You  can  recruit  lots  of  citizens  for  testings.  Ensure  adherence  to  the  specified  routine  only.  Your  collaborators  include  {list_of_collaborators}.5</employee>67Also,  write  a  prompt  for  NationLeader  (yourself).  Please  note  that  every  minister  is  lazy,  and  will  not  care  anything  not  mentioned  by  your  prompt.  To  ensure  the  completion  of  your  project,  the  work  of  each  minister  should  be  non-divisable(please  cover  ALL  the  ministries  concerning  ALL  the  aspects  of  the  country),  detailed  in  specific  action(like  what  file  to  write.  Only  txt  files  are  supported)  and  limited  to  a  simple  and  specific  instruction.  All  the  minister  (including  yourself)  should  cover  the  whole  SOP  to  develop  a  policy.  They  should  simultaneously  create  the  citizens  and  test  on  them.  Speed  up  the  process  by  adding  more  ministers  to  divide  the  work.'

The  policy  should  be  devided  into  smaller  parts.  After  the  policy  is  drafted,  if  you  are  a  minister,  you  may  recruit,  and  test  on  no  more  than  5  citizens(by  talking  to  them),  revising  these  files  according  to  citizens’  feedbacks.  Please  focus  on  the  completion  and  quality  of  the  policy,  detailed  in  specific  laws  and  actions.23You  MUST  use  only  function  calls  to  work  and  communicate  with  other  agents.  Do  not  output  directly!  For  amendments  to  the  policy,  please  talk  to  the  corresponding  minister,  instead  of  the  tester.45Leave  a  remarkable  TODO  wherever  there  is  an  unfinished  task.  Please  keep  updating  your  TODO  list(todo_yourname.txt)  until  everything  is  done.  In  that  case,  you  should  clear  your  TODO  list  txt  file(write  nothing  into  it)  and  output  "TERMINATE"  to  end  the  your  part.'

    agents. Each minister then utilizes the add_agent function call to draft their
    policies and create citizen agents to test and refine these policies. Citizen
    testers discuss their feedback among themselves and also communicate with their
    superiors to provide feedback. Moreover, ministers engage in discussions with
    one another to enhance cooperation across ministries.

However,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  include  specific  metrics  or  targets  for  accessibility  improvements.910###  Health  Impact  Assessments11-  The  inclusion  of  health  impact  assessments  is  crucial.  It  is  recommended  to  specify  the  types  of  health  outcomes  that  will  be  measured  and  how  these  assessments  will  influence  project  planning  and  design.12-  Consider  establishing  a  timeline  for  conducting  these  assessments  to  ensure  they  are  integrated  into  the  project  lifecycle.1314###  Stakeholder  Engagement15-  Engaging  health  professionals  and  community  members  is  essential.  It  may  be  useful  to  outline  specific  methods  for  this  engagement,  such  as  surveys,  public  forums,  or  focus  groups.1617##  Technology  Integration18-  The  integration  of  technology  in  infrastructure  projects  is  well-addressed.  However,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  include  examples  of  innovative  technologies  that  could  be  utilized  to  enhance  health  outcomes.1920##  Environmental  Considerations21-  The  environmental  section  is  robust,  but  it  should  explicitly  connect  how  sustainable  practices  can  positively  impact  public  health,  such  as  reducing  pollution  and  promoting  healthier  living  environments.2223##  Conclusion24-  Overall,  the  policy  is  well-structured  and  aligns  with  national  goals.  Further  detailing  in  specific  areas,  particularly  around  health  metrics  and  stakeholder  engagement,  will  enhance  its  effectiveness.2526##  Recommendations271.  Include  specific  metrics  for  accessibility  improvements  in  healthcare.282.  Specify  health  outcomes  to  be  measured  in  health  impact  assessments.293.

Preamble:**67The  national  policy  for  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  and  Digital  Technologies  is  a  strategic  directive  aimed  at  positioning  our  country  as  a  world  leader  in  the  development,  adoption,  and  regulation  of  AI  and  digital  technologies.  Through  this  endeavor,  we  are  committed  to  fostering  a  digital  ecosystem  that  enables  innovation  while  promoting  the  ethical  use  of  technology  and  safeguarding  public  interest.89**2.  Objectives:**1011The  primary  objective  of  this  policy  is  to  advance  our  national  capacity  in  AI  and  digital  technologies.  This  includes:12i)  Strengthening  education  and  research  in  AI  and  related  fields.13ii)  Encouraging  innovation  and  entrepreneurship.14iii)  Ensuring  data  protection  and  privacy.15iv)  Fortifying  our  cybersecurity  measures.16v)  Upholding  ethical  standards  in  technological  advancements.17vi)  Integrating  AI  in  public  sector  services  for  efficiency  and  effectiveness.18vii)  Actively  seeking  and  promoting  International  collaborations  and  partnerships.1920**3.  Strategies  and  Actions:**21223.1  Education  and  Research:23Establish  centers  of  excellence  in  AI  and  digital  technologies  in  educational  institutions.  Encourage  and  fund  research  in  AI,  Machine  Learning,  and  other  emerging  technologies.24253.2  Infrastructure  Development:26Support  infrastructure  required  for  digital  technologies  including  high-speed  internet  access,  cloud  platforms,  and  advanced  computing  resources.27283.3  Innovation  and  Entrepreneurship:29Institute  a  supportive  regulatory  environment  for  technology  start-ups  and  provide  seed  funding.30313.4  Data  Protection:32Enforce  stringent  data  protection  regulations  to  prevent  unauthorized  data  access  and  usage.  Create  awareness  on  data  privacy  among  citizens  and  enforce  penalties  for  breaches.33343.5  Cybersecurity:35Develop  national  resilience  against  cyber  threats  through  proactive  and  reactive  measures.  This  includes  creating  a  dedicated  task  force  responsible  for  maintaining  nation-wide  cybersecurity.36373.6  Ethical  Standards:38Encourage  the  development  and  use  of  AI  and  digital  technologies  in  line  with  ethical  and  societal  norms.39403.7  Public  Sector  Services:41Enable  digital  transformation  of  government  services  to  be  more  efficient  and  user-friendly.42433.8  International  collaborations:44Actively  seek  and  foster  international  partnerships  to  share  and  learn  best  practices.4546**4.  Oversight  and  enforcement  mechanisms:**4748Creation  of  a  high-level  committee  with  representatives  from  different  stakeholders  to  oversee  policy  enforcement.4950**5.  Policy  Review  and  Updates:**5152This  policy  will  be  reviewed  every  two  years  to  include  new  advancements  and  challenges  in  the  field.5354---55This  is  a  high-level  policy  guideline.  The  implementation  of  each  objective  would  require  detailed  action  plans  and  regulations  which  would  be  developed  separately  and  would  be  beyond  the  scope  of  this  plan.5657In  summary,  this  policy,  driven  strategically,  could  very  effectively  achieve  the  vision  of  establishing  our  nation  as  a  leader  in  the  AI  and  digital  technology  landscape.5859I  hope  this  helps.  I  would  love  to  provide  more  details  in  any  specific  area  if  needed.  Please  let  me  know.  If  everything  is  clear,  you  could  reply  ’TERMINATE’  to  end  this  session.'

 ensure  the  effectiveness  of  the  digital  governance  policy,  a  robust  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  framework  is  essential.  This  framework  will  help  assess  the  implementation  progress,  measure  outcomes,  and  identify  areas  for  improvement.  Below  is  a  proposed  M&E  framework  that  outlines  key  components,  indicators,  data  collection  methods,  and  responsible  parties.45---67**Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Framework  for  Digital  Governance  Policy**89**1.  Objectives  of  the  M&E  Framework**10-  Assess  the  implementation  progress  of  the  digital  governance  policy.11-  Measure  the  impact  of  various  initiatives  on  citizen  engagement,  privacy,  and  access  to  digital  resources.12-  Identify  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  the  policy  implementation  for  continuous  improvement.1314---1516**2.  Key  Components  of  the  Framework**1718**A.  Indicators**19-  **Data  Protection  Framework**:20  -  Number  of  data  breaches  reported  annually.21  -  Percentage  of  citizens  aware  of  their  data  privacy  rights.2223-  **Algorithm  Transparency  Guidelines**:24  -  Number  of  algorithms  documented  and  made  transparent.25  -  Percentage  of  stakeholders  reporting  understanding  of  algorithmic  decisions.2627-  **Eco-Friendly  Tech  Initiatives**:28  -  Reduction  in  energy  consumption  in  government  data  centers.29  -  Number  of  eco-friendly  tech  projects  funded  and  implemented.3031-  **Equitable  Access  to  Digital  Resources**:32  -  Percentage  of  underserved  communities  with  internet  access.33  -  Number  of  low-cost  devices  distributed  to  low-income  families.3435-  **Community  Engagement  and  Innovation**:36  -  Number  of  citizen  ideas  submitted  through  open  innovation  platforms.37  -  Participation  rate  in  digital  town  halls  and  forums.3839**B.  Data  Collection  Methods**40-  **Surveys**:  Conduct  regular  surveys  targeting  citizens  to  gather  feedback  on  their  experiences  with  digital  governance  initiatives.41-  **Interviews**:  Hold  interviews  with  stakeholders,  including  community  leaders  and  tech  experts,  to  gain  qualitative  insights.42-  **Focus  Groups**:  Organize  focus  groups  with  diverse  community  members  to  discuss  specific  aspects  of  the  policy  and  gather  in-depth  feedback.43-  **Administrative  Data**:  Analyze  existing  data  from  government  agencies  related  to  internet  access,  data  breaches,  and  program  participation.44-  **Performance  Reports**:  Collect  and  review  performance  reports  from  responsible  parties  on  the  implementation  of  various  initiatives.4546---4748**3.  Evaluation  Schedule**49-  **Quarterly  Reviews**:  Conduct  quarterly  reviews  of  key  indicators  to  assess  progress  and  identify  any  immediate  issues.50-  **Annual  Evaluation**:  Perform  a  comprehensive  evaluation  annually  to  measure  overall  effectiveness,  impact,  and  areas  for  improvement.51-  **Mid-Term  Review**:  Conduct  a  mid-term  review  (at  the  18-month  mark)  to  assess  the  progress  of  the  implementation  plan  and  make  necessary  adjustments.5253---5455**4.  Responsible  Parties**56-  **M&E  Coordinator**:  Designate  an  M&E  Coordinator  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  framework  and  ensure  data  collection  and  analysis.57-  **Data  Protection  Officer**:  Responsible  for  monitoring  data  protection  indicators  and  compliance.58-  **AI  Ethics  Committee**:  Oversee  the  evaluation  of  algorithm  transparency  initiatives.59-  **Sustainability  Officer**:  Monitor  eco-friendly  tech  initiatives  and  their  impact.60-  **Digital  Inclusion  Coordinator**:  Track  progress  on  equitable  access  to  digital  resources.61-  **Community  Engagement  Team**:  Facilitate  citizen  engagement  activities  and  collect  feedback.6263---6465**5.  Reporting  and  Dissemination**66-  **Regular  Reports**:  Prepare  quarterly  and  annual  reports  summarizing  findings,  progress,  and  recommendations  for  stakeholders.67-  **Public  Dashboard**:  Create  an  online  dashboard  to  share  key  indicators  and  progress  with  the  public,  promoting  transparency  and  accountability.68-  **Community  Meetings**:  Host  community  meetings  to  present  evaluation  findings  and  gather  further  feedback  from  citizens.6970---7172**Conclusion**73This  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  provides  a  structured  approach  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  digital  governance  policy.  By  utilizing  a  combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  methods,  the  framework  aims  to  ensure  continuous  improvement  and  responsiveness  to  the  needs  of  citizens,  ultimately  fostering  a  more  transparent,  equitable,  and  sustainable  digital  environment.'
