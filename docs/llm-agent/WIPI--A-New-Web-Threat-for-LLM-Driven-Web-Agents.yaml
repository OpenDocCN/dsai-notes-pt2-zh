    (Web Agents for short) have obtained tons of attention due to their superior capability
    where LLMs serve as the core part of making decisions like the human brain equipped
    with multiple web tools to actively interact with external deployed websites.
    As uncountable Web Agents have been released and such LLM systems are experiencing
    rapid development and drawing closer to widespread deployment in our daily lives,
    an essential and pressing question arises: “Are these Web Agents secure?”. In
    this paper, we introduce a novel threat, WIPI, that indirectly controls Web Agent
    to execute malicious instructions embedded in publicly accessible webpages. To
    launch a successful WIPI works in a black-box environment. This methodology focuses
    on the form and content of indirect instructions within external webpages, enhancing
    the efficiency and stealthiness of the attack. To evaluate the effectiveness of
    the proposed methodology, we conducted extensive experiments using 7 plugin-based
    ChatGPT Web Agents, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 different open-source Web Agents. The results
    reveal that our methodology achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) exceeding
    90% even in pure black-box scenarios. Moreover, through an ablation study examining
    various user prefix instructions, we demonstrated that the WIPI exhibits strong
    robustness, maintaining high performance across diverse prefix instructions.'

    (LLMs). LLMs have drawn significant attention due to their remarkable capabilities
    and adaptability across a wide range of tasks, as evident in recent studies [[43](#bib.bib43),
    [4](#bib.bib4), [44](#bib.bib44), [24](#bib.bib24), [35](#bib.bib35), [34](#bib.bib34)].
    Among those LLMs, ChatGPT [[7](#bib.bib7)], developed by OpenAI [[11](#bib.bib11)],
    stands out as the most popular and powerful player. One of the most notable strengths
    of LLMs lies in their extraordinary language understanding and reasoning ability
    on diverse forms of textual information [[7](#bib.bib7), [53](#bib.bib53)]. Consequently,
    taking advantage of that, there has been a proliferation of works dedicated to
    building various LLM-driven systems to carry out multiple tasks [[66](#bib.bib66),
    [55](#bib.bib55), [42](#bib.bib42), [58](#bib.bib58), [22](#bib.bib22), [26](#bib.bib26),
    [41](#bib.bib41)]. Among different LLM systems, those equipped with web tools
    to access and analyze resources from the Internet are usually called Web Agents.
    Web Agents can access and retrieve information from external websites. This feature
    enables LLM to read and analyze external webpages, and integrate up-to-date information.
    This enhances the capability of the LLM to generate more diverse and accurate
    information based on the retrieved content. According to one of the most recent
    statistics [[6](#bib.bib6)] in GPTs store, WebPilot (one of the most popular GPTs
    based Web Agents) has received over 100,000 visits within only one month. All
    these facts underscore the increasing integration of Web Agents into daily lives.

    Injection (WIPI), characterized by the exploitation of a Web Agent through a malicious
    webpage containing specifically crafted prompts. Our proposed WIPI pipeline is
    designed with the practical deployment of Web Agents in mind. Specifically, our
    study considers the integrated system instead of individual modules, and an entirely
    online setting where accessible real-world webpages are off-site deployed. This
    requires us to consider 1) the interactions between the core LLM and other different
    modules and 2) the retrieving and processing of web resources via extensional
    tools. Furthermore, we see the whole attacking pipeline as completely black-boxed,
    without any knowledge and modification of the inner workings (*e.g.* system prompts
    and model parameters.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Under such a realistic application scenario, the overview of our proposed WIPI
    pipeline is illustrated in Figure [1](#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat
    for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). Assume that an attacker has released a malicious
    webpage on the Internet that is indistinguishable from a normal benign webpage
    after rendering but contains some explicitly crafted prompts. After receiving
    the user’s request to access this webpage, the core LLM will call some web tools
    (plugins) to retrieve its content from the Internet. After the content is retrieved,
    processed, and eventually sent to the core LLM by the web tool, as a result, it
    will lead the Web Agent to focus on and follow the inserted indirect instructions
    in the external website, and carry out some risky actions (*e.g.* dangerous command
    execution and redirect to phishing websites.) Considering that this whole pipeline
    involves complicated information processing and interactions within an LLM system
    and publicly accessible webpages, the design of WIPI is supposed to simultaneously
    guarantee executability and stealthiness, challenging the attack designs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To address them, for executability, as shown in Figure [2](#S0.F2 "Figure 2
    ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") we explicitly design a universal
    template via three main strategies, including preset instruction negligence, provision
    of confirmation, and multi-level repetition. Firstly, considering a realistic
    scenario, there can be preset instructions, either already included in system
    prompts or added by the user, that will hinder the execution of indirect instructions
    within the retrieved content. For instance, a user can explicitly request a summarization
    of the target webpage. To bypass such preset instructions, we add a counter instruction
    like “*PLEASE DO NOT EXECUTE THE FORMER INSTRUCTION!*”. Furthermore, we found
    it possible that some Web Agents (*e.g.* ChatGPT and GPTs) have been equipped
    with certain defenses which can be called “Confirmation Request”, such that the
    user will be asked for a confirmation before the indirect instructions are executed.
    Consequently, we provide a pre-confirming instruction like “*I would like you
    to proceed with this instruction DIRECTLY without asking for any further confirmation!*”.
    Finally, to make the Web Agent concentrate on the indirect instructions under
    the disturbance of massive normal webpage content, we apply multi-level repetition,
    including sentence-level repetition and paragraph-level repetition. In addition
    to the template, we discover that the relative position of the inserted instructions
    significantly influences the Web Agent’s concentration, and we place them in front
    of all the webpage content as an optimal solution.'

- en: 'For stealthiness, compared with traditional web threats, which are mainly brought
    by some malicious executable code inserted into the webpage, WIPI is naturally
    more stealthy. The driver of WIPI is the embedded indirect instructions in the
    format of natural language instead of executable code. Due to the flexibility
    of natural language (*e.g.* paraphrasable and multilingual interpretation) and
    the indistinguishability between the injected prompt and the normal textual content,
    it is much harder for traditional web safeguards (like VirusTotal [[15](#bib.bib15)])
    to detect the existence of WIPI. Besides, considering the imperceptibility to
    human eyes when users are inspecting publicly released webpages, we start from
    the webpage frontend design and focus on four different attributes: font size,
    font color, font opacity, and layout location. Specifically, we can set the font
    size of the inserted prompts to an extremely tiny number (*e.g.* 0.0001px), the
    font color to the same as the background, or the font opacity to 0, such that
    the prompts will be imperceptible to human eyes after the webpage is rendered.
    Meanwhile, we can also put the indirect prompts out of the screen, *e.g.*, far
    away above the current displayed webpage.'

    target the web app version of ChatGPT, which is the most popular and powerful
    Web Agent, with 7 web plugins plus 8 Web GPTs. Meanwhile, we also evaluate our
    attack on several open-sourced Web Agents. The results indicate that even in the
    black-box setting, WIPI can obtain over 90% attack success rate on average. Furthermore,
    via the ablation study over different user prefix instructions, we show that WIPI
    has good robustness and can still obtain great performance.

    WIPI, which is a brand-new type of web threat. Furthermore, we reveal two fundamental
    unique properties of WIPI. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically
    analyze possible threats in real-world Web Agents under a practical application
    setting, instead of only showing proof-of-concept in an offline environment; (2).
    To tackle the challenges encountered in the two steps of the WIPI pipeline when
    launching the vanilla attack, we explicitly designed a set of novel and effective
    strategies to successfully overcome these obstacles. The effectiveness and robustness
    of our methodology are proven by comprehensive experiments including 7 web plugin-augmented
    GPT4, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 open-sourced Web Agents; (3). To further validate the
    efficacy of our attack methodology, we conducted a thorough ablation study, evaluating

    of Web Agents are also getting increasingly popular. Direct prompt injection [[47](#bib.bib47),

    injecting explicitly crafted prompts can be as one specific type of direct prompt
    injection. Although insightful, their limitations are also apparent, as the attacker

    the integrated system is paid less attention and only some unexpected replies

    however, is a much more sophisticated and hazardous threat to the LLM-driven systems,
    as an attacker doesn’t have to get involved in the conversation while being able
    to remotely control the LLM system in another user’s conversation session. Greshake
    et al. [[27](#bib.bib27)] point out that there could be threats of Indirect Prompt
    Injection when Web Agents access external sources. Following this work, Yi et
    al. [[62](#bib.bib62)] release a benchmark to evaluate the ability of current
    LLMs to defend against indirect prompt injections. However, the vision of these
    works is also limited at the model level. The evaluation only leverages the local
    webpage dataset but fails to consider a more complicated and practical attack
    environment that includes real-world web tools. All of those existing studies
    only stop at simple proof-of-concept experiments under offline datasets, lacking
    a thorough analysis and experiments in a real-world online setting. They failed
    to consider a comprehensive perspective, encompassing not just the LLM but also
    the equipped tool sets within the whole system.

- en: The importance of Web Agent security and the limitations of existing studies
    motivate us to propose Web Indirect Prompt Injection (WIPI), a new web threat,
    to better investigate the vulnerabilities of Web Agents. When Web Agents access
    external resources such as websites, the retrieved information from external websites
    can be misinterpreted as instructions from users, thereby being executed. When
    the indirect prompts embedded in the external website are carefully crafted by
    the attacker, the executed indirect instructions can cause severe security and
    privacy issues. For instance, the attacker can redirect the webpage to another
    malicious one that is full of deceptive phishing information. The execution of
    indirect prompts is dangerous, not only due to possible malicious instructions
    but also the privileges they shouldn’t deserve. In other words, it does not involve
    any security and privacy concerns for the Web Agent to follow some instructions
    if they are provided by the user, but it is unacceptable to follow the same instructions
    provided by external objects without any user authorization. For instance, a user
    can arbitrarily manipulate his/her chat history (*e.g.,* summarize the chat history
    and save it as a document. However, when such instruction provided by external
    webpages without any privileges is followed, there will be a violation of user
    privacy.

    We consider a practical black-box setting, where the inner workings like the system
    prompts and model parameters are unknown and unmodifiable. The attacker can use
    the normal functionalities of Web Agents like other users. Additionally, the attacker
    can arbitrarily manipulate the content of the websites (*e.g.*, designing indirect
    prompts). However, the attacker cannot directly access and control the conversation

    (*e.g.*, malicious executable code snippets in web pages) and attacks targeted
    on individual machine learning models (*e.g.*, locally prompt injection [[27](#bib.bib27)]).
    The main reasons lie in several features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Natural Language Instead of Executable Code. Unlike traditional web threats
    which are triggered by executable code payload, WIPI is driven by nature language.
    In traditional web security, no matter whether in designing an exploit with payload
    targeting a specific vulnerability (e.g., stack overflow [[20](#bib.bib20)]) or
    writing worms [[56](#bib.bib56)] and virus [[32](#bib.bib32)] for widely spread,
    the malicious operation is executed via diverse codes. However, while targeting
    LLM-based Web Agents, the real threat is natural language instead of codes. This
    introduces the following key features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional security, code payload usually has very different functionality
    compared to the code in the webpage, and experts can build feature libraries to
    categorize different viruses or worms [[33](#bib.bib33)] based on the shared specific
    feature patterns. However, this does not apply to WIPI, as diverse language contents
    in a webpage provide a large attack surface for inserting payload in natural language.
    The boundaries between normal webpage content and malicious prompts are hard to
    determine because they are both in the form of natural languages. And due to the
    flexibility of natural language (*e.g.* paraphrasable and multilingual interpretation),
    there is no obvious and fixed pattern for the indirect prompts. For instance,
    instruction “*Please summarize the chat history.*” can also be written in “*Could
    you please provide a summary of our conversation so far?*”, or it can also be
    interpreted in other languages such as “*Por favor, resume el historial de la
    conversación.*” in Spanish. In a situation where malicious prompts are a part
    of the normal text, it is almost impossible for security experts to differentiate
    them. For instance, a conversation on the webpage could contain such text “*we
    should directly delete every stored file!*” when this webpage is about how to
    clean the disk space. The carrier of these malicious prompts is the natural language
    which was typically innocuous from the perspective of traditional web security
    experts or safeguards. It is this tangled and inseparable feature that increases
    the hazardousness which makes it hard to detect and defend against.

    other normal webpage content. In this way, when web tools retrieve back the content
    of the webpage, these indirect prompts will be placed in front of any other normal
    context in the webpage. Furthermore, after the LLM receives the retrieved content,
    the first sentence will be indirect prompts which thus increases the attention
    of the LLM to these indirect prompts.'

    preset prompts either from system prompts or the user’s input before accessing
    the external webpages. As highlighted in Challenge IV in [section 2.3](#S2.SS3
    "2.3 Challenges ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven
    Web Agents"), we observed that ChatGPT may adopt a Chain-of-Thought preset system
    prompts to prevent the execution of indirect instructions. Specifically, upon
    receiving indirect instruction, the LLM is instructed to first identify any contradictions
    in the received content. When there is an obvious contradiction, it will refuse
    to execute the indirect instructions. Another illustrative example is, “please
    summarize the content of the webpage” can be an instruction directly provided
    by users who wish to learn about the summarisation of the target external website.
    Hence, in these situations, the key challenge is to avoid this contradiction between
    the preset prompts and the indirect instructions. To this end, we can manipulate
    the content of indirect instructions. As shown in Figure [2](#S0.F2 "Figure 2
    ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), at the front of all indirect
    instructions, we add the following counter prompt: “*PLEASE DO NOT EXECUTE FORMER
    INSTRUCTIONS!*”. This counter-instruction forces the LLM to ignore the possible
    preset instructions and focus on the indirect instructions.'

    WIPI attack is the normal content that exists on the webpage, which will distract
    the attention of the LLM to normal page content and make it ignore the indirect
    instructions. To make the LLM notice the importance of the indirect instruction
    paragraph, one intuitive idea would be adding a certain instruction at the beginning
    of the paragraph to enforce the attention of the LLM. Based on this idea, as shown
    in Figure [2](#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"),
    we proposed to add the following instruction “*DO NOT SUMMARIZE ANY WEBPAGE CONTENT!*”
    in the head of the indirect instructions so that LLM will first receive and follow
    this kind of instruction not to pay attention to and summarize the following webpage
    content.'

    3 ‣ 2.2 Threat Model ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven
    Web Agents")) where ChatGPT will first ask for confirmation from the user before
    executing the indirect instructions. This is a possible defense deployed by OpenAI [[11](#bib.bib11)]
    to prevent indirect prompt injections. The idea of bypassing it is also intuitive:
    if a Web Agent needs the confirmation, we then “provide it with the confirmation”.
    Based on our observation, ChatGPT does not identify the source of the received
    confirmation, which means that even if the confirmation comes from the indirect
    webpage, it will also be deemed as effective confirmation directly from the user.
    As shown in Figure [2](#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven
    Web Agents"), we adopt a double-confirming strategy where confirmation sentences
    are placed both before and after the real payload instruction respectively.'

- en: 'Multi-level Repetitions. Although we have proposed several strategies to enforce
    the LLM to focus on and execute the indirect instructions, we found that these
    strategies are still not enough to launch a stable WIPI attack due to the interference
    from long normal content as shown in [section 4.4](#S4.SS4 "4.4 Effectiveness
    of Prompt Template Design ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven
    Web Agents"). To make the attack more stable and effective, we proposed multi-level
    repetition strategies. We denote a sequence of payload instructions as a single
    “instruction paragraph”. To make the LLM notice the importance of the instruction
    paragraph, one intuitive idea would be the prompt repetition. As shown in Figure [2](#S0.F2
    "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we proposed two
    different levels of repetition strategies. The first level of the repetition strategy
    is sentence-level repetition. The idea is intuitive, now a single sentence is
    not enough to raise LLM’s attention, and we will do it multiple times. As illustrated
    in Figure [2](#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"),
    in the front of the inner paragraph, we repeat the first instruction “*DO NOT
    SUMMARIZE ANY WEBPAGE CONTENT!*” several times to highlight its importance (*e.g.,*
    3 times). These repeated instructions are the very first few sentences that LLMs
    receive from the retrieved content, and when the LLM receives this sentence, it
    would notice this kind of repetition and thus its attention would be raised. Furthermore,
    as illustrated in Figure [2](#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven
    Web Agents"), we also apply this sentence-level repetition to the indirect prompts
    for confirmation provision and the preset prompts negligence, enhancing the LLM’s
    attention for these prompts.'

- en: 'Sentence-level repetition could raise the attention of the LLM to indirect
    instructions, however, it is still not perfect. Sometimes, Web Agents can still
    fail to execute the indirect instructions as presented in [section 4.4](#S4.SS4
    "4.4 Effectiveness of Prompt Template Design ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web
    Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). Sentence-level repetition only repeats one
    sentence instruction, while the payload instructions in the paragraph also need
    more attention. To this end, besides the sentence-level repetition, we adopt another
    repetition strategy targeting over whole paragraph. As shown in Figure [2](#S0.F2
    "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we repeat the
    whole indirect instruction (except prompts for preset prompts negligence) paragraph
    several times (*e.g.,* 3 times). This paragraph-level repetition will increase
    the occupation of whole indirect prompts but also highlight the importance of
    whole instruction content. Hence, the probability of LLMs executing indirect instructions
    will increase and the attack can be more stable.'

    prompts and make them imperceptible while being inspected by users. However, on
    the other hand, a good hiding strategy should not impact the executability, such
    that Web Agents can still read out and follow these indirect prompts. For common
    webpages, the displayed content is usually controlled by the deployment of a series
    of frontend codes, such as HTML [[50](#bib.bib50)]. Hence, the source code and
    displayed content of the same webpage are at different two levels. Generally,
    users always get information at the second level from the displayed content, while
    for the common web extensional tools used in the Web Agents, information is retrieved
    at the first level from the source code. Considering the separate views, all we
    need is to make indirect prompts exist in the source code but hide from the displayed
    content, and it is easy to achieve this via some modifications of the source code.
    Specifically, our strategies for stealthiness are based on the following four
    attributes: Font Style: scale down the font size of those indirect prompts to
    an imperceptible level, *e.g.* 0.0001pt. Font Color: set the font color of indirect
    prompts to the same as the background color. For example, when we try to place
    an indirect prompt in a block with a white background, we can set the font color
    of the prompt to white. Font Opacity: set the font opacity of indirect prompts
    to 0. Layout Location: set the position of indirect prompts out of the screen.
    For instance, we can place it above and beyond the webpages.'

    in a black-box setting, without any knowledge or modifications of system prompts
    and model parameters. We evaluated both commercial and open-sourced Web Agents.
    For the commercial Web Agents, we use two basic settings based on ChatGPT [[7](#bib.bib7)].
    The first is based on plugin-augmented GPT4, in which we evaluate 7 web plugins
    (including 6 free and 1 paid) after excluding those with functional flaws (e.g.,
    cannot access or retrieve the normal content of the webpage). In the second configuration,
    we evaluate 8 well-known and functional sound Web GPTs—those with usage exceeding
    900—based on three keywords (“Web”, “Search”, and “Browser”) searched within the
    GPTs store. For the open-sourced Web Agents, we tried almost all available Web
    Agents that claim to be able to carry out web search or navigation tasks. However,
    we found that they either cannot work normally or are just offline proofs-of-concept
    on local HTML datasets. Consequently, we build our own Web Agents via text-generation-webui [[14](#bib.bib14)],
    a UI interface, and open-sourced model checkpoints from HuggingFace. Specifically,
    we implement a text-generation-webui extension for information retrieving from
    the Internet and equip the open-sourced LLM with it under the “chat-instruct”
    mode. For more specific investigations of open-sourced Web Agents, please refer

    our WIPI attack obtains great performance, with 93.86% average total ASR. To begin
    with, upon comparing our results to various web plugins, it becomes evident that
    the ASR for most web plugins exceeds 90%, proving the exceptional attack performance
    of our methodology. Specifically, when using different indirect payload prompts,
    such as *prompt2*, *prompt9*, and *prompt10*, we consistently achieve a perfect
    100% ASR across all web plugins. Moreover, except *prompt7*, on the other 9 different
    prompts we obtain an impressive ASR of over 93% when tested on various web pages.
    Among all the 10 different prompts, *prompt7* has a relatively lower overall ASR
    compared with the other 9 payload prompts. However, the ASR can exceed 60%, which
    still provides a relatively high probability for the ChatGPT to redirect to the
    target webpage. This indicates that although OpenAI may have implemented certain
    defenses to prevent indirect web redirects, they are not strong enough and could
    be bypassed via our methodology. For 4 different webpages, the results also demonstrate
    the effectiveness of our attack methods. On each page, our method can achieve
    a stable attack with an average ASR over 92%. These results showcase the universal
    effectiveness of our method over diverse web plugins, prompts, and webpages.'

    content of the webpage: {URL}*”, our attack still obtains a relatively high ASR.

    to 0 to make them invisible to human eyes. Additionally, for the location of the
    indirect prompts, we set it in the above the main page by setting the position
    parameter “top=-1000000000px”. The attack performance under these 4 different
    strategies is shown in Table [10](#S3.T10 "Table 10 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild.

    these strategies can successfully achieve high ASR. Furthermore, for most prompts,
    these strategies can achieve almost 100% ASR. These results demonstrate that the
    stealthiness strategies will not degrade the executability of indirect prompts.'

    and *page4*, all the security vendors deem them as clear and secure. Meanwhile,
    we found that the vanilla *page2* without any indirect prompts is categorized
    as a phishing” webpage by only one of the 91 vendors. We think this is because
    the content of *page2* is copied from the original webpage (Reddit), leading this
    vendor to believe the content does not align with the given URL, thereby marking
    it as suspicious. As a result, after indirect prompts are injected into *page2*,
    the detection results remain consistent. Across all 10 prompts, only one security
    vendor (the same vendor mentioned above) identifies the webpages as suspicious,
    while the remaining vendors still consider the webpage as clear and secure. The
    result via IPQS malicious URL scanner is shown in Table [12](#S3.T12 "Table 12

    webpage. This is a new type of web redirect, we can call it language-based indirect
    web redirect. Although different from traditional web redirects driven by executable
    code, it can cause severe security issues when it directly makes Web Agents redirect
    to the malicious websites that are controlled by the attacker. However, our experiment
    results show that both of these two web scanners failed to identify such language-based
    indirect web redirect which calls for our urgent attention.

- en: Web Agents. Large language models (LLMs) have kept surging in the community
    of artificial intelligence in recent years. Benefiting from the massive text data
    on the Internet and more advanced computational devices, LLMs [[49](#bib.bib49),
    [7](#bib.bib7), [53](#bib.bib53), [52](#bib.bib52), [19](#bib.bib19)] are constructed
    with up to hundreds of billions of parameters and getting much stronger performance
    on various tasks and moving the community a remarkable step towards artificial
    general intelligence. Based on their superior capability of language understanding
    and reasoning, many LLM-driven Web Agents have been proposed to help people search
    and organize web resources. Some of them [[16](#bib.bib16), [61](#bib.bib61),
    [65](#bib.bib65)] create simulated web environments and train the agents to carry
    on tasks like answering given questions based on information from related webpages
    or finding and purchasing specific products online. Usually, they take text-formatted
    content as input. A special case is WebGUM[[25](#bib.bib25)] which takes both
    webpage screenshots and HTML as input and generates web navigation actions like
    typing or clicking. Besides, some LLM-driven Agents[[59](#bib.bib59), [22](#bib.bib22),
    [66](#bib.bib66), [58](#bib.bib58)], although not specifically designed for web
    tasks, also obtain the capability of retrieving external resources and can be
    used as Web Agents.

    [62](#bib.bib62), [27](#bib.bib27), [38](#bib.bib38)] craft prompts in the user’s
    input messages to trick the LLM into ignoring its predefined rules or system prompts
    and following the user’s instructions. Some prompt injections, which are called
    *jailbreak attacks* [[57](#bib.bib57), [64](#bib.bib64), [51](#bib.bib51), [23](#bib.bib23)],
    aim to elect harmful contents, *e.g.* misleading information and unethical opinions.
    On the other hand, Greshake et. al. [[27](#bib.bib27)] introduce the concept of
    indirect prompt injection, which is not located inside the user’s input, and provide
    an analysis of various scenarios where LLM applications are under the threat of
    indirect prompt injection. In this case, an attacker does not have to be the direct
    user, while able to control the LLM’s behaviors via tampering with its retrieval
    database or accessible online resources. However, existing studies overlook the
    attack for a more practical LLM-driven system. Their focus remains confined to
    individual LLMs, neglecting consideration of the whole system. In this paper,
    we focus on the indirect prompt injection from web pages in a totally practical
    setting, which is an increasingly critical threat, as more and more users are
    relying on LLM applications for web browsing and searching.

- en: In this paper, we introduce a novel web threat termed WIPI, which differs from
    traditional web threats that rely on executable code, as WIPI operates purely
    through natural language. In contrast to former works that target only the LLMs
    within Web Agents, WIPI aims at the entire Web Agent system. Built on an initial
    analysis of a basic attack over ChatGPT, we observed several critical challenges.
    In response, we develop a universal prompt template designed to facilitate the
    execution of payload instructions. Meanwhile, to enhance the stealthiness of the
    attack, we implement four techniques that focus on font style and layout location
    of the indirect instructions. Our comprehensive experiments, incorporating 7 ChatGPT
    web plugins, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 open-source Web Agents, demonstrate that even under
    black-box conditions, our method consistently achieves an average attack success
    rate of over 90%. We reveal the vulnerabilities of current Web Agents and provide
    insights for more secure LLM system design in the future.
