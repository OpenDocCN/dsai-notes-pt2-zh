- en: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled understanding
    webpage contexts, product details, and human instructions. Utilizing LLMs as the
    foundational architecture for either reward models or policies in reinforcement
    learning has gained popularity - a notable achievement is the success of InstructGPT
    (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib12)). RL algorithms have been instrumental in maximizing
    long-term customer satisfaction and avoiding short-term, myopic goals in industrial
    recommender systems, which often rely on deep learning models to predict immediate
    clicks or purchases.

    WebShop (Yao et al., [2023](#bib.bib18)) benchmark environment, data, simulator,
    and pre-trained model checkpoints. The goal is to train an RL agent to maximize
    the purchase reward given a detailed human instruction describing a desired product.

    objectives, learning from preferences without a reward model, and employing contemporary
    training techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as used in InstructGPT
    (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib12)), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
    (Rafailov et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)). This report also evaluates the RL agents
    trained using generative trajectories. Evaluations were conducted using Thompson
    sampling in the WebShop simulator environment.

- en: The simulated online experiments demonstrate that DPO outperforms PPO in data
    efficiency and task performance, especially in success rate, using the same amount
    of training time. However, longer training time is necessary for fair comparison
    between the two. Specifically, without utilizing any image, a DPO agent achieved
    a 19% success rate after approximately 3000 steps or 30 minutes of training on
    T4 GPUs, compared to a PPO agent, which reached a 15% success rate after 2 hours
    of training. Results also indicate that agents trained on generated trajectories
    exhibited comparable task performance to those trained using human trajectories.
    This has demonstrated an example of an extremely low-cost data-efficient way of
    training reinforcement learning agents.

- en: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
    research and applications in understanding human instructions on the web, processing
    webpage text, and grasping context. These advancements have provided valuable
    tools for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to navigate web environments,
    particularly in e-commerce and various recommender systems such as YouTube and
    Netflix. Leveraging LLMs in RL agent training is relatively new but has proven
    successful. A notable example is InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib12)),
    where an RL agent was trained using human preferences by fine-tuning GPT-3 models
    with human instructions. Combining LLMs with RL techniques enables the creation
    of intelligent web agents that can understand human instructions and complete
    tasks in web or app environments, thereby maximizing desired rewards.

    immediate user responses such as clicks (Covington et al., [2016](#bib.bib5);
    Zhang et al., [2017](#bib.bib19)). This approach has seen tremendous success in
    personalized user engagement. However, after several years in production, deep
    supervised learning algorithms have shown limitations, including: 1) a focus on
    optimizing short-term gains at the expense of long-term user satisfaction and
    retention, and 2) strong feedback loops caused by training data generated from
    these algorithms, which exacerbate these effects. Conversely, RL algorithms are
    designed to optimize long-term gains by learning policies that maximize long-term
    user satisfaction. RL agents are also well-known for their ability to perform
    sequential planning and make decisions based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP)
    properties (Chen et al., [2018](#bib.bib3)).'

    studied, with several benchmark datasets and trained agents available. For example,
    WikiNav (Nogueira and Cho, [2017](#bib.bib11)) provides a benchmark for web-based
    navigation RL agents. RecoGym (Rohde et al., [2018](#bib.bib14)) offers a benchmark
    for RL agents in production recommendations for online advertising. Virtual-Taobao
    (Shi et al., [2019](#bib.bib16)) includes a virtual online shopping environment
    derived from Taobao, hosting several RL algorithms for product recommendations.
    WebShop (Yao et al., [2023](#bib.bib18)) presents a simulated e-commerce web environment
    with over 1,600 human demonstrations for web shopping tasks based on human text
    instructions. This environment includes 1.18 million products with text and image
    descriptions, along with 12,087 crowd-sourced text instructions. The authors of
    WebShop also explored several imitation and RL agents trained using real-world
    human trajectories.

    reformulation, as published in (Nogueira and Cho, [2017](#bib.bib11)), is part
    of an RL problem aimed at optimizing outcomes. In this context, search engines
    are considered black boxes, and the RL agent (or reformulator) learns to generate
    queries that maximize the expected return through actions in the state space.
    This paper, published in 2017, predates the widespread use of BERT (Devlin et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib6)). The authors proposed a PRF framework, with CNN/RNN serving
    as the contextual learner and query generator. A more recent work proposed the
    concept of ”learning to search” (Adolphs et al., [2021](#bib.bib2)), where a search
    agent mimics the interactive process by generating interactive search queries
    based on previous queries and saving the best queries along the way. The authors
    used the T5 model with fine-tuning as a query generator to interact with the search
    engine iteratively, producing a set of fine-grained queries that yield better
    outcomes. Another related work, WebGPT (Nakano et al., [2021](#bib.bib10)), utilizes
    a web interface and a search engine to train RL agents to answer questions.

    models for search and choice (or clicks). The search model is an imitation learning
    model (search-IL) mimicking human search queries from instructions. It is a human
    instruction and query pair fine-tuned BART (Lewis et al., [2020](#bib.bib8)) model
    in root. For choice (clicks) learning, the authors present a few reinforcement
    learning models to optimize choice of clicks navigating the recommender simulator
    to optimize the end rewards (purchase). The reward is calculated by a scoring
    function to quantify the relevance between a purchased product and the human instruction,
    based on attributes of the product. The imitation learning algorithm (choice-IL)
    presented by the original authors is a human trajectory fine-tuned BERT (Devlin
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib6)) model in root. The reinforcement learning algorithm
    for choice iterates the imitation learned (choice-IL-RL), fine-tuned BERT model
    as the baseline and iterates the optimization using a mixed objectives of policy
    gradients and cross entropy.

    extensive simulated online experiments using Thompson sampling to analyze the
    performance differences across trained agents. The goal of Thompson sampling is
    to select the optimal action (or ”arm”) that minimizes overall regret. However,
    when sampling over a small number of steps, it may not be ideal for estimating
    rewards from arms that are perceived as less optimal due to insufficient exploration.
    To address this, we use multiple parallel runs of Thompson sampling, each with
    1000 rollouts, to capture variability across runs. Careful experimental design
    and calculated rollouts of online experiments are necessary for accurately estimating
    the rewards and success rates of each agent. The aim of this project is to implement

    similarly to DPO agents trained using generated trajectories, albeit with larger
    variance in success rate across runs. The smaller variance observed in self-learning

    used for training the DPO agent with human data.

    possibility of underestimating data inefficiency or bottleneck when training over
    long period of times using the same set of data. When training an agent for production
    systems, the limited number of available trajectories can result in decreased
    task performance due to insufficient information learned from the limited data.
    In reality, collecting human data is expensive and time-consuming. This issue
    can be mitigated by generating preferred and unpreferred trajectories to serve
    as a continuous, low-cost source of training data.

- en: With very limited training time (¡1 hour), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
    outperforms Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), offering better task performance
    and higher success rates with less training time. However, more evaluations with
    longer training time are necessary to draw a conclusion. Using a DPO agent trained
    within one hour and without image data, we achieved a success rate of approximately
    19%. This is higher than the success rate of an RL agent trained with an RNN network
    (without pre-trained models for search or choice imitation learning), which has
    an 18% success rate from the original paper.

- en: PPO is known to be able to provide less volatile training and approximately
    monotonic guarantees for RL objectives. By nature, PPO’s regularization and clipping
    of objectives prevent rapid policy changes, making it suitable for problems with
    smaller state and action spaces where large policy changes are not expected. However,
    in the context of online product recommenders, where the state-action space can
    expand to millions of dimensions, and rapid policy changes are essential for fast
    learning, PPO can need longer time to train.

- en: Training DPO agents with generated trajectories has shown great potential. With
    only 100 generated human trajectories and the same amount of computational resources,
    the task performance was comparable to a DPO agent trained using 1200 human trajectories.
    This approach addresses data inefficiency and the high costs of human data collection.
    As training requires more time and data, the limited availability of human data
    can hinder continuous improvement. This exercise demonstrates that generated trajectories
    can be nearly as effective as human trajectories and can even serve as a continuous,
    low-cost source of training data. Additionally, generated trajectories allow exploration
    of successful paths not seen by humans, similar to the approach that contributed
    to the success of AlphaGo(Silver et al., [2016](#bib.bib17)) and AlphaZero, which
    were trained using self-play rather than past human games.
