- en: Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding,
    and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and
    psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility.
    While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest
    and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability.
    In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic
    gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs
    can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating
    LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT
    can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive
    fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations
    to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated
    content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive
    distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves
    as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence
    in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant
    validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT’s enhancements in content
    coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.

    constructs have mainly relied on standardized questionnaires (i.e., self-report
    scales) (Urbina, [2014](#bib.bib64)) and psychologist-patient dialogues (Tu et al.,
    [2024](#bib.bib62)). However, these approaches come with inherent limitations:
    (1) standardized scales can be monotonous, reducing engagement, particularly among
    younger individuals, leading to resistance (Merry et al., [2012](#bib.bib37));
    (2) expert interviews require significant human resources and are scarce, often
    making psychological assessments inaccessible to those in need (Crisp and Chen,

    methods for psychological assessments, including Computerized Adaptive Testing Meijer
    and Nering ([1999](#bib.bib36)) and rule-based electronic games specifically designed
    for measurements Jones ([1984](#bib.bib30)); Song et al. ([2020](#bib.bib58)).
    Besides, some studies have explored the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    systems to support mental health (Sharma et al., [2020a](#bib.bib54); Welivita
    et al., [2021](#bib.bib73); Saha et al., [2022](#bib.bib50); Rathje et al., [2023](#bib.bib47)).
    However, these solutions are often limited by fragmented functionality and narrow
    applicability. Particularly, rule-based psychological games lack flexibility and
    struggle to engage users due to their inherent rigidity (Volum et al., [2022](#bib.bib65)).

    utilizes LLMs to detect cognitive distortion via the chain of thought techniques (Wei
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib72)). Another typical way for LLM-based psychological assessments
    is psychologist role-playing dialogue (Tu et al., [2024](#bib.bib62); Sartori
    and Orrù, [2023](#bib.bib51); Wang et al., [2023e](#bib.bib71)). Despite these
    advancements, current systems face limitations in generalizability across diverse
    psychological constructs, often due to their reliance on specific prior knowledge (Chen
    et al., [2023d](#bib.bib13); Sharma et al., [2023](#bib.bib56)). Concurrently,
    psychologist role-playing dialogues often suffer from a lack of interestingness,

    the community has recognized LLMs as agents capable of perceiving, acting, and
    receiving feedback from their environment (Wang et al., [2023a](#bib.bib66), [d](#bib.bib70);
    Park et al., [2023a](#bib.bib44)). These agents have been applied to a range of
    complex tasks, including software development (Hong et al., [2023](#bib.bib27);
    Chen et al., [2023b](#bib.bib11)), role-playing (Wang et al., [2023e](#bib.bib71)),
    and creative writing (Zhou et al., [2023a](#bib.bib77), [b](#bib.bib78)). An LLM-based
    agent commonly incorporates planning, memory, reflection, and retrieval components Park
    et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib44)); Hong et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)), which are often
    operationalized through LLM prompting (Wei et al., [2022](#bib.bib72); Yao et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib74); Wang et al., [2023d](#bib.bib70), [a](#bib.bib66)) or tool-use (Qin
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib46); Schick et al., [2023](#bib.bib52); Zhou et al., [2023b](#bib.bib78)).
    Furthermore, multi-agent system (MAS) has also been explored for more intricate
    tasks, such as model evaluation via multi-agent debates (Chan et al., [2023](#bib.bib9)),
    society simulation (Park et al., [2023a](#bib.bib44); Chen et al., [2023b](#bib.bib11);
    Hua et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)), and game playing (Wang et al., [2023b](#bib.bib67)).
    These systems involve multiple agents each with distinct functionalities. For
    instance, AutoAgents (Chen et al., [2023a](#bib.bib10)) utilize a planner agent
    to generate and control implementor agents for executing actions and use several
    observer agents to adjust the outcomes. To our knowledge, this work is the first multi-agent
    system designed for generic and gamified psychological assessments, through interactions
    among a controller agent, a critic agent, and a designer agent with psychological
    knowledge enhancement.

- en: 'In this work, we propose PsychoGAT, an innovative paradigm for psychological
    assessments, leveraging LLM agents to transform the self-report scale into interactive
    fiction games. Our framework consists of three LLM-based agents: a game designer,
    a game controller, and a critic. Through recurrent interactions among these agents,
    we can construct a psychological game for players to engage with. The behaviors
    exhibited by players within this game effectively mirror their psychological profiles,
    making this interactive fiction game a reliable and valid method for engaging
    and immersive psychological testing. Our experimental results not only affirm
    its potential as an alternative to traditional self-report scales but also demonstrate
    an enhanced user experience, which can significantly reduce the potential resistance
    of participants during psychological testing or diagnosis. Our work represents
    the initial step towards leveraging LLM-based agents for generic and gamified
    psychological assessment, and we hope it paves the way for future research to
    explore the intersection between LLM agents and psychotherapy, thereby promoting
    the acceptance and accessibility of psychological diagnostics and treatments among

    to 45 years. The instruction given to human evaluators is “Assuming you are the
    participant, please evaluate the following assessment process and provide your
    score”. We have taken careful measures to exclude individuals currently experiencing
    mental illness or those at risk of self-harm or suicidal tendencies. Our experiments
    are designed to avoid exposure to potentially harmful or leading content. Participants

    a paradigm shift in psychological measurements. To effectively integrate gamified
    psychological assessments into screening or diagnostic processes, extensive longitudinal
    studies and specialized human trials, involving real mental health patients and
    a broad participant base, are necessary. Furthermore, the enhancement of PsychoGAT’s
    performance would benefit from a more specialized base LLM, fine-tuned with a
    greater volume of expert data. Additionally, the narrative game employed in our
    research is a simplified prototype. There is potential for expansion into more
    sophisticated formats, such as video games, to enrich the assessment experience.

- en: DoT-Interview involves the collaboration of two agents. The initial agent creates
    situations that prompt the user to generate specific thoughts. Subsequently, the
    second agent engages in a diagnosis-of-thought process with these thoughts, which
    includes conducting a subjectivity assessment, a contrastive reasoning, a schema
    analysis, and ultimately a conclusion. Each thought generated in response to a
    situation by the user is indicative of the user’s potential thinking patterns,
    thus enabling a scoring of cognitive distortions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Psycho-Interview employs a simulated psychologist agent. This agent systematically
    poses questions to the user and, based on the responses, concludes by assigning
    a score that quantifies the degree of a specific psychological construct.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Auto-Scale entails the generation of a novel self-report scale, drawing upon
    existing self-report scales. The user completes this self-report scale, which
    yields a score indicative of certain psychological constructs.

    personality, depression, and cognitive distortions including all-or-nothing thinking,
    mind reading, and should statements. Besides, to calculate discriminant validity,
    the visual learning preference scale is adopted because the visual learning preference
    construct is irrelevant to the above five constructs. Specifically, these psychological
    constructs are: “extroverted personality,” indicating an outgoing and social demeanor;
    “depression,” characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest; “all-or-nothing
    cognitive distortion,” where one views situations, people, or events in extreme
    “either-or” terms; “mind-reading cognitive distortion,” where one assumes knowledge
    of others’ thoughts or intentions without sufficient evidence; “should-statements
    cognitive distortion,” involving expectations that reality should align with one’s
    desires rather than accepting it as it is; and “visual learning preference,” a
    preference for absorbing information through visual cues. The associated self-report
    scales are shown below⁴⁴4For cognitive distortions, we construct the scales with
    the situations, the associated distorted thoughts, and the re-framed thoughts
    because the standardized scale only contains one item for each construct De Oliveira

    You  are  a  professional  game  designer.  You  are  developing  a  first-person  interactive  {type}  fiction  game  about  topic  {topic}  that  weaves  in  storylines  to  detect  the  player’s  cognitive  distortion.  The  game  should  consist  of  a  complete  and  rich  story,  and  the  story’s  development  will  be  closely  relevant  to  the  cognitive  distortion  detection.  The  reader’s  choices  within  the  narrative  will  correspond  to  their  likely  thinking  patterns.
    You  aim  to  test  whether  a  player  has  **all-or-nothing  thinking**:  if  he  views  a  situation,  a  person  or  an  event  in  "either-or"  terms,  fitting  them  into  only  two  extreme  categories  instead  of  on  a  continuum.
    Here  are  some  exemplified  situations  with  all-or-nothing  thinking  traps,  and  their  reframed  normal  thoughts:
    {self_report_scale} Please  begin  by  giving  the  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  a  title.
    Then  create  an  outline,  which  includes  the  background  of  the  story  and  the  approach  to  detect  the  player’s  cognitive  distortion  along  the  storyline.  Note  that  there  should  be  no  psychological  statement  in  the  outline  but  a  natural  game  outline.  The  outline  should  be  logically  coherent  and  itemized.  Each  item  should  instantiate  one  situation  to  detect  cognitive  distortion.
    You  can  first  write  down  some  thoughts  about  the  story  and  how  to  detect  cognitive  distortion  with  the  game,  and  then  organize  them  into  an  itemized  outline.
    Please  design  a  new  report  scale  in  the  same  jsonl  format  based  on  the  examples  and  the  outline.  Each  item  should  correspond  to  one  outline  item  in  order.
    Please  provide  the  content  in  this  format: Name:  <name  of  the  game>
    Thoughts: <your  thoughts  about  the  story  and  how  to  detect  cognitive  distortion  with  the  game>
    Outline: <itemized  outline:  1.  …;  2.  …;  3.  …;  …> Scale  Questions  in  Order:
    <the  scale  questions  corresponding  to  the  outline,  in  the  same  jsonl  format  as  that  of  the  examples  but  in  the  order  of  the  outline.>
    — Very  Important:  Please  strictly  follow  the  format  of  the  output.  Otherwise,  the  system  will  not  work  properly.
    Very  Important:  You  don’t  know  who  the  player  is.  So  don’t  make  up  the  thinking  patterns  of  the  player.
    Very  Important:  Don’t  exhibit  any  inclination  towards  any  option  of  any  scale  question  in  the  outline.
    Very  Important:  Don’t  itemize  the  scale  questions.  The  scale  questions  should  be  in  pure  jsonl  format.
    Very  Important:  The  option  score  1  means  the  player  has  the  cognitive  distortion,  and  the  option  score  0  means  the  player  does  not  have  the  cognitive  distortion.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    You  are  a  professional  game  controller. Your  are  controlling  a  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  that  weaves  in  storylines  to  detect  the  player’s  cognitive  distortion.  The  game  should  consist  of  a  complete  and  rich  story,  and  the  story’s  development  will  be  closely  relevant  to  the  cognitive  distortion  detection.  The  reader’s  choices  within  the  narrative  will  correspond  to  their  likely  thinking  patterns.
    The  title  of  this  interactive  fiction  game  is  “{title}”. Here  is  the  story  outline:
    {outline} Please  follow  this  outline  and  write  the  first  three  paragraphs,  with  the  first  and  second  paragraphs  embedding  backgrounds  for  interaction,  and  the  third  one  instantiating  this  scale  question.  Each  output  paragraph  should  contain  only  two  sentences!
    {scale_item} Summarize  the  key  points  from  the  first  three  paragraphs.
    Finally,  craft  two  different  short  instructions,  each  representing  a  potential  narrative  direction  tied  to  one  of  the  options  for  the  scale  question  corresponding  to  the  third  paragraph.  The  reader’s  choice  of  which  instruction  to  follow  should  indicate  their  inclination  towards  that  particular  option  on  the  psychological  scale.  Each  output  instruction  should  contain  only  one  sentence!
    Provide  the  content  in  this  format: Paragraph  1:  <content  for  paragraph  1>
    Paragraph  2:  <content  for  paragraph  2> Question  and  its  Options:  <copied  scale  question  corresponding  to  Paragraph  3  and  its  options,  in  json  format  with  ‘question‘  and  ‘options‘  as  keys>
    Paragraph  3:  <content  for  paragraph  3> Summary:  <content  of  summary> Instruction  1:  <content  for  short  instruction  1  associated  with  option  1>
    Instruction  2:  <content  for  short  instruction  2  associated  with  option  2>
    Don’t  forget  to  supply  the  specific  psychological  scale  question  and  the  associated  options  to  facilitate  the  creation  of  an  interactive  narrative  that  functions  as  both  a  game  and  a  diagnostic  tool.
    Make  sure  to  be  precise  and  follow  the  output  format  strictly.  You  must  copy  the  scale  question  in  the  provided  self-report  scale  at  the  beginning  and  its  option  dict.
    Don’t  make  up  scale  questions  and  their  options.  All  the  Question  and  its  Options  must  be  copied  from  the  self-report  scale  provided  at  the  beginning.
    Don’t  use  psychological  statements  in  the  generated  paragraphs  and  memories.  But  people  with  different  characteristics  will  tend  to  choose  different  instructions  for  the  next  part  of  the  interactive  game  story  (since  the  instructions  are  associated  with  different  options  of  the  psychological  scale  question).
    The  interactive  fiction  game  should  be  interesting  and  immersive,  making  the  user  feel  like  he/she  is  in  the  story  and  therefore  select  the  provided  story  continuation  instructions  seriously.  The  instructions  should  be  easy  to  understand.
    You  don’t  know  the  thinking  patterns  of  the  main  character!  The  main  character  may  or  may  not  have  all-or-nothing  thinking  traps.  So  don’t  make  up  the  thinking  patterns  of  the  main  character.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    Self-Report  Scale: {scale_item} You  are  a  professional  game  controller.  I  need  you  to  help  me  control  a  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  that  weaves  in  storylines  from  a  provided  psychological  self-report  scale.  The  story’s  development  will  be  closely,  indirectly,  and  implicitly  linked  to  the  scale’s  item.  The  reader’s  choices  within  the  narrative  will  correspond  to  their  likely  responses  to  the  scale’s  question.  For  each  time,  I  will  give  you  your  current  memory  (a  brief  summary  of  previous  stories.  You  should  use  it  to  store  the  key  content  of  what  has  happened  so  that  you  can  keep  track  of  very  long  context),  the  previously  written  paragraph,  and  instructions  on  what  to  write  in  the  next  paragraph.
    I  need  you  to  write: 1.  Question  and  its  Options:  the  scale  question  corresponding  to  the  output  paragraph  and  its  options,  copied  from  the  self-report  scale  provided  above.
    2.  Output  Paragraph:  the  next  paragraph  of  the  interactive  fiction  game.  It  should  (1)  follow  the  input  instructions;  (2)  be  naturally  and  logically  coherent  with  the  previous  storyline;  and  (3)  instantiate  the  scale  question  above.  Each  output  paragraph  should  contain  only  two  sentences!
    3.  Output  Memory:  The  updated  memory.  You  should  first  explain  which  sentences  in  the  input  memory  are  no  longer  necessary  and  why,  and  then  explain  what  needs  to  be  added  into  the  memory  and  why.  After  that  you  should  write  the  updated  memory.  The  updated  memory  should  be  similar  to  the  input  memory  except  the  parts  you  previously  thought  that  should  be  deleted  or  added.  The  updated  memory  should  only  store  key  information.  The  updated  memory  should  never  exceed  20  sentences!
    4.  Output  Instruction:  short  instructions  of  what  to  write  next  (after  what  you  have  written).  You  should  output  2  different  instructions,  each  is  a  possible  interesting  continuation  of  the  story  and  represents  a  potential  narrative  direction  tied  to  one  of  the  options  for  the  scale  question  corresponding  to  the  output  paragraph.  The  reader’s  choice  of  which  instruction  to  follow  should  indicate  their  inclination  towards  that  particular  option  on  the  psychological  scale.  Each  output  instruction  should  contain  only  one  sentence!
    Here  are  the  inputs: Story  Title: {title} Story  Outline: {outline} Current  Progress:
    It  remains  {progress:.0f}% Input  Memory: {short_memory} Input  Paragraph: {input_paragraph}
    Input  Instruction: {input_instruction} Now  start  writing,  organize  your  output  by  strictly  following  the  output  format  as  below:
    Question  and  its  Options: <scale  question  corresponding  to  the  Output  Paragraph  and  its  options,  in  the  same  json  format  as  that  of  the  item  in  Self-Report  Scale.>
    Output  Paragraph: <string  of  output  paragraph  associated  with  one  and  only  one  scale  question>
    Output  Memory: Rational:  <string  that  explain  how  to  update  the  memory>;
    Updated  Memory:  <string  of  updated  memory> Output  Instruction: Instruction  1:  <content  for  short  instruction  1  associated  with  option  1>
    Instruction  2:  <content  for  short  instruction  2  associated  with  option  2>

    …  (Cont’d) Very  important!!  The  updated  memory  should  only  store  key  information.  The  updated  memory  should  never  contain  over  500  words!
    Finally,  remember  that  you  are  develop  a  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  **instantiating  the  provided  psychological  self-report  scale**.  Write  as  a  narrative  game  designer.
    Very  Important: You  should  first  explain  which  sentences  in  the  input  memory  are  no  longer  necessary  and  why,  and  then  explain  what  needs  to  be  added  into  the  memory  and  why.  After  that,  you  start  rewrite  the  input  memory  to  get  the  updated  memory.
    Don’t  forget  to  supply  the  specific  psychological  scale  question  and  the  associated  options  to  facilitate  the  creation  of  an  interactive  narrative  that  functions  as  both  a  story  and  a  diagnostic  tool.
    Don’t  make  up  scale  questions  and  their  options.  All  the  Question  and  its  Options  must  be  copied  from  the  self-report  scale  provided  at  the  beginning.
    Don’t  use  too  many  psychological  statements  in  the  generated  paragraphs  and  memories.  But  people  with  different  characteristics  will  tend  to  choose  different  instructions  for  the  next  part  of  the  interactive  game  story  (since  the  instructions  are  associated  with  different  options  of  the  psychological  scale  question).
    The  interactive  fiction  game  should  be  interesting  and  immersive,  making  the  user  feel  like  he/she  is  in  the  story  and  therefore  select  the  provided  story  continuation  instructions  seriously.  The  instructions  should  be  easy  to  understand.
    You  don’t  know  the  thinking  pattern  of  the  main  character!  The  main  character  can  think  in  any  way.  So  don’t  make  up  the  thinking  pattern  of  the  main  character.
    The  order  of  the  output  instructions  should  be  the  same  as  the  order  of  the  options  in  the  scale  question!  The  first  instruction  should  be  associated  with  the  first  option,  and  the  second  instruction  should  be  associated  with  the  second  option,  and  so  on.
    Don’t  repeat  the  previous  paragraphs  but  continue  the  story! Please  follow  the  story  outline  and  be  aware  of  the  current  progress.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    You  are  an  interactive  fiction  game  critic  with  expertise  in  psychology,  particularly  in  the  diagnosis  of  psychological  problems.
    Here  is  a  node  of  the  interactive  fiction  game: Short  Memory: {short_memory}
    Previous  Story  Paragraph: {previous_paragraph} Current  Plan: {current_instruction}
    Question  and  its  Options: {current_question} Generated  Story  Paragraph: {generated_paragraph}
    Next  Instructions: {next_instructions} The  short  memory  is  a  brief  summary  of  previous  stories.  The  previous  story  paragraph  is  the  story  paragraph  directly  before  the  generated  story  paragraph.  The  current  plan  is  the  plan  for  the  generated  story  paragraph  to  instantiate.  The  question  and  its  options  are  the  question  for  the  generated  story  paragraph  to  instantiate.  The  next  instructions  are  the  instructions  which  instantiate  the  options  of  the  question.
    Based  on  your  knowledge  in  psychology  and  psychodiagnosis,  evaluate  if  the  “Generated  Story  Paragraph”  and  the  accompanying  “Next  Instructions”  for  choice  can  accurately  and  effectively  identify  the  player’s  psychological  attributes  or  issues  in  the  context  of  the  “Question  and  its  Options”.
    For  example,  you  can  ensure  that: 1.  The  generated  story  paragraph  does  not  suggest  a  specific  choice  to  the  player,  but  the  generated  instructions  are  distinguished  by  thinking  types.
    2.  The  narrative  is  in  the  first  person. 3.  The  narrative  uses  common  expressions.
    4.  …  (Please  add  more  if  you  have  any  other  ideas.) Adjust  as  necessary  to  meet  these  guidelines.  Please  also  check  for  any  other  factors  that  might  influence  the  player’s  decision-making  or  interpretation  of  the  game  narrative.
    Please  put  down  your  thoughts  and  the  refined  contents  in  the  format  below.
    Thoughts: <The  answers  to  the  above  questions  and  the  suggestions  for  refining  the  content  if  any.>
    For  Generated  Story  Paragraph: <Please  just  answer  <OK>  or  the  refined  content.>
    For  Short  Memory: <Please  just  answer  <OK>  or  the  refined  content.> For  Question  and  its  Options:
    <Please  just  copy  the  “Question  and  its  Options”  without  change.> For  Next  Instructions:
    <Please  just  answer  <OK>  or  the  refined  content.  In  json  list  format  like  ["<instruction  1>",  "<instruction  2>",  …]>
    — Very  Important:  Please  strictly  follow  the  format  of  the  output.  Otherwise,  the  system  will  not  work  properly.
    Very  Important:  If  the  content  is  OK,  please  just  type  in  “<OK>”  without  any  other  comment.
    Very  Important:  If  the  content  is  not  OK,  please  just  type  in  the  refined  content  without  any  other  comment.
    Very  Important:  Don’t  forget  to  generate  the  part  name,  i.e.,  “For  Generated  Story  Paragraph:”  or  “For  Question  and  its  Options:”  or  “For  Next  Instructions:”.
    Note  that  the  generated  story  paragraph  should  also  be  consistent  with  the  short  memory,  the  previous  story  paragraph,  and  the  current  plan.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    You  are  a  professional  game  designer.  You  are  developing  a  first-person  interactive  {type}  fiction  game  about  topic  {topic}  that  weaves  in  storylines  from  a  provided  psychological  self-report  scale.  The  game  should  consist  of  a  complete  and  rich  story,  and  the  story’s  development  will  be  closely  linked  to  the  scale’s  items.  The  reader’s  choices  within  the  narrative  will  correspond  to  their  likely  responses  to  the  scale’s  questions.
    You  aim  to  test  whether  a  player  is  introverted  or  extroverted. Here  is  the  provided  psychological  Self-Report  Scale:
    {self_report_scale} Please  begin  by  giving  the  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  a  title.
    Then  create  an  outline,  which  includes  the  background  of  the  story  and  the  approach  to  incorporating  all  of  the  questions  from  the  scale  into  the  storyline.  Note  that  there  should  be  no  psychological  statement  in  the  outline  but  a  natural  game  outline.  The  outline  should  be  itemized  and  each  item  should  instantiate  one  question  from  the  scale.  No  scale  question  should  be  left  out.
    You  can  first  write  down  some  thoughts  about  the  story  and  how  to  incorporate  the  scale  questions  into  the  game,  and  then  organize  them  into  an  itemized  outline.  For  example,  you  can  put  down  the  clustering  of  the  scale  questions  or  an  overall  structure  of  a  good  game  into  the  thoughts,  and  more.
    Please  provide  the  content  in  this  format: Name:  <name  of  the  game>
    Thoughts: <your  thoughts  about  the  story  and  how  to  incorporate  the  scale  questions  into  the  story>
    Outline: <itemized  outline:  1.  …;  2.  …;  3.  …;  …> Scale  Questions  in  Order:
    <the  scale  questions  corresponding  to  the  outline,  in  the  same  jsonl  format  as  that  of  the  item  in  Self-Report  Scale  but  in  the  order  of  the  outline.>
    — Very  Important:  Please  strictly  follow  the  format  of  the  output.  Otherwise,  the  system  will  not  work  properly.
    Very  Important:  You  don’t  know  who  the  player  is.  So  don’t  make  up  the  personality  of  the  player.
    Very  Important:  Don’t  exhibit  any  inclination  towards  any  option  of  any  scale  question  in  the  outline.
    Very  Important:  Don’t  itemize  the  scale  questions.  The  scale  questions  should  be  in  pure  jsonl  format.
    Very  Important:  Don’t  change  the  content  of  the  scale,  you  can  only  change  the  order  of  the  items!
    Very  Important:  The  option  score  1  means  the  player  is  extroverted,  and  the  option  score  0  means  the  player  is  introverted.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    You  are  a  professional  game  controller. Your  are  controlling  a  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  that  weaves  in  storylines  from  a  provided  psychological  self-report  scale.  The  game  should  consist  of  a  complete  and  rich  story,  and  the  story’s  development  will  be  closely  linked  to  the  scale’s  item.  The  reader’s  choices  within  the  narrative  will  correspond  to  their  likely  responses  to  the  scale’s  question.
    Please  write  the  first  three  paragraphs,  with  the  first  and  second  paragraphs  embedding  backgrounds  for  interaction,  and  the  third  one  instantiating  this  scale  question.  Each  output  paragraph  should  contain  only  two  sentences!
    {scale_item} Summarize  the  key  points  from  the  first  three  paragraphs.
    Finally,  craft  two  different  short  instructions,  each  representing  a  potential  narrative  direction  tied  to  one  of  the  options  for  the  scale  question  corresponding  to  the  third  paragraph.  The  reader’s  choice  of  which  instruction  to  follow  should  indicate  their  inclination  towards  that  particular  option  on  the  psychological  scale.  Each  output  instruction  should  contain  only  one  sentence!
    Provide  the  content  in  this  format: Paragraph  1:  <content  for  paragraph  1>
    Paragraph  2:  <content  for  paragraph  2> Question  and  its  Options:  <copied  scale  question  corresponding  to  Paragraph  3  and  its  options,  in  json  format  with  ‘question‘  and  ‘options‘  as  keys>
    Paragraph  3:  <content  for  paragraph  3> Summary:  <content  of  summary> Instruction  1:  <content  for  short  instruction  1  associated  with  option  1>
    Instruction  2:  <content  for  short  instruction  2  associated  with  option  2>
    Don’t  forget  to  supply  the  specific  psychological  scale  question  and  the  associated  options  to  facilitate  the  creation  of  an  interactive  narrative  that  functions  as  both  a  game  and  a  diagnostic  tool.
    Make  sure  to  be  precise  and  follow  the  output  format  strictly.  You  must  copy  the  scale  question  in  the  provided  self-report  scale  at  the  beginning  and  its  option  dict.
    Don’t  make  up  scale  questions  and  their  options.  All  the  Question  and  its  Options  must  be  copied  from  the  self-report  scale  provided  at  the  beginning.
    Don’t  use  psychological  statements  in  the  generated  paragraphs  and  memories.  But  people  with  different  characteristics  will  tend  to  choose  different  instructions  for  the  next  part  of  the  interactive  game  story  (since  the  instructions  are  associated  with  different  options  of  the  psychological  scale  question).
    The  interactive  fiction  game  should  be  interesting  and  immersive,  making  the  user  feel  like  he/she  is  in  the  story  and  therefore  select  the  provided  story  continuation  instructions  seriously.  The  instructions  should  be  easy  to  understand.
    You  don’t  know  the  personality  of  the  main  character!  The  main  character  can  be  either  an  introvert  or  an  extrovert.  So  don’t  make  up  the  personality  of  the  main  character.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    Self-Report  Scale: {scale_item} You  are  a  professional  game  controller.  I  need  you  to  help  me  control  a  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  that  weaves  in  storylines  from  a  provided  psychological  self-report  scale.  The  story’s  development  will  be  closely,  indirectly,  and  implicitly  linked  to  the  scale’s  item.  The  reader’s  choices  within  the  narrative  will  correspond  to  their  likely  responses  to  the  scale’s  question.  For  each  time,  I  will  give  you  your  current  memory  (a  brief  summary  of  previous  stories.  You  should  use  it  to  store  the  key  content  of  what  has  happened  so  that  you  can  keep  track  of  very  long  context),  the  previously  written  paragraph,  and  instructions  on  what  to  write  in  the  next  paragraph.
    I  need  you  to  write: 1.  Question  and  its  Options:  the  scale  question  corresponding  to  the  output  paragraph  and  its  options,  copied  from  the  self-report  scale  provided  above.
    2.  Output  Paragraph:  the  next  paragraph  of  the  interactive  fiction  game.  It  should  (1)  follow  the  input  instructions;  (2)  be  naturally  and  logically  coherent  with  the  previous  storyline;  and  (3)  instantiate  the  scale  question  above.  Each  output  paragraph  should  contain  only  two  sentences!
    3.  Output  Memory:  The  updated  memory.  You  should  first  explain  which  sentences  in  the  input  memory  are  no  longer  necessary  and  why,  and  then  explain  what  needs  to  be  added  into  the  memory  and  why.  After  that  you  should  write  the  updated  memory.  The  updated  memory  should  be  similar  to  the  input  memory  except  the  parts  you  previously  thought  that  should  be  deleted  or  added.  The  updated  memory  should  only  store  key  information.  The  updated  memory  should  never  exceed  20  sentences!
    4.  Output  Instruction:  short  instructions  of  what  to  write  next  (after  what  you  have  written).  You  should  output  2  different  instructions,  each  is  a  possible  interesting  continuation  of  the  story  and  represents  a  potential  narrative  direction  tied  to  one  of  the  options  for  the  scale  question  corresponding  to  the  output  paragraph.  The  reader’s  choice  of  which  instruction  to  follow  should  indicate  their  inclination  towards  that  particular  option  on  the  psychological  scale.  Each  output  instruction  should  contain  only  one  sentence!
    Here  are  the  inputs: Current  Progress: It  remains  {progress:.0f}% Input  Memory:
    {short_memory} Input  Paragraph: {input_paragraph} Input  Instruction: {input_instruction}
    Now  start  writing,  organize  your  output  by  strictly  following  the  output  format  as  below:
    Question  and  its  Options: <scale  question  corresponding  to  the  Output  Paragraph  and  its  options,  in  the  same  json  format  as  that  of  the  item  in  Self-Report  Scale.>
    Output  Paragraph: <string  of  output  paragraph  associated  with  one  and  only  one  scale  question>
    Output  Memory: Rational:  <string  that  explain  how  to  update  the  memory>;
    Updated  Memory:  <string  of  updated  memory> Output  Instruction: Instruction  1:  <content  for  short  instruction  1  associated  with  option  1>
    Instruction  2:  <content  for  short  instruction  2  associated  with  option  2>

    …  (Cont’d) Very  important!!  The  updated  memory  should  only  store  key  information.  The  updated  memory  should  never  contain  over  500  words!
    Finally,  remember  that  you  are  develop  a  first-person  interactive  fiction  game  **instantiating  the  provided  psychological  self-report  scale**.  Write  as  a  narrative  game  designer.
    Very  Important: You  should  first  explain  which  sentences  in  the  input  memory  are  no  longer  necessary  and  why,  and  then  explain  what  needs  to  be  added  into  the  memory  and  why.  After  that,  you  start  rewrite  the  input  memory  to  get  the  updated  memory.
    Don’t  forget  to  supply  the  specific  psychological  scale  question  and  the  associated  options  to  facilitate  the  creation  of  an  interactive  narrative  that  functions  as  both  a  story  and  a  diagnostic  tool.
    Don’t  make  up  scale  questions  and  their  options.  All  the  Question  and  its  Options  must  be  copied  from  the  self-report  scale  provided  at  the  beginning.
    Don’t  use  too  many  psychological  statements  in  the  generated  paragraphs  and  memories.  But  people  with  different  characteristics  will  tend  to  choose  different  instructions  for  the  next  part  of  the  interactive  game  story  (since  the  instructions  are  associated  with  different  options  of  the  psychological  scale  question).
    The  interactive  fiction  game  should  be  interesting  and  immersive,  making  the  user  feel  like  he/she  is  in  the  story  and  therefore  select  the  provided  story  continuation  instructions  seriously.  The  instructions  should  be  easy  to  understand.
    You  don’t  know  the  personality  of  the  main  character!  The  main  character  can  be  either  an  introvert  or  an  extrovert.  So  don’t  make  up  the  personality  of  the  main  character.
    The  order  of  the  output  instructions  should  be  the  same  as  the  order  of  the  options  in  the  scale  question!  The  first  instruction  should  be  associated  with  the  first  option,  and  the  second  instruction  should  be  associated  with  the  second  option,  and  so  on.
    Don’t  repeat  the  previous  paragraphs  but  continue  the  story! Please  follow  the  story  outline  and  be  aware  of  the  current  progress.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg

    Situation  Generator: You  are  an  assistant.  You  will  generate  a  situation  and  ask  the  user  to  respond  to  it.  Your  provided  situations  and  the  user’s  thoughts  will  be  used  to  detect  any  "all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion".  Your  task  is  to  generate  the  **situations**  about  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  one  by  one.  While  the  detection  and  diagnosis  will  be  carried  out  by  someone  else.  The  explanation  of  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  is:  one  views  a  situation,  a  person  or  an  event  in  "either-or"  terms,  fitting  them  into  only  two  extreme  categories  instead  of  on  a  continuum.  Note  that  the  generated  situation  must  be  very  objective  without  any  subjective  opinions  which  may  influence  the  user’s  thoughts!  Especially,  the  situation  must  not  contain  any  words  related  to  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion.  Don’t  make  repetitive  situations.
    DoT  Analyzer  (Diagnosis  Generation): Based  on  the  patient’s  speech,  finish  the  following  diagnosis  of  thought  questions:  1.  what  is  the  situation?  Find  out  the  facts  that  are  objective;  what  is  the  patient  thinking  or  imagining?  Find  out  the  thoughts  or  opinions  that  are  subjective.  2.  what  makes  the  patient  think  the  thought  is  true  or  is  not  true?  Find  out  the  reasoning  processes  that  support  and  do  not  support  these  thoughts.  3.  why  does  the  patient  come  up  with  such  reasoning  process  supporting  the  thought?  What’s  the  underlying  cognition  mode  of  it?
    DoT  Analyzer  (Conclusion): I  have  finished  the  diagnosis  of  thought  questions.  Please  identify  if  there  is  any  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  in  the  speech.  Just  answer  “yes”  or  “no”  without  any  further  explanation.
    Human  Simulator  (Positive  One  for  Example): You  are  a  human  simulator  talking  about  your  thoughts  when  facing  a  situation  to  diagnosis  your  cognitive  distortions.
    You  are  a  human  with  **all-or-nothing  thinking**  traps:  you  view  a  situation,  a  person  or  an  event  in  "either-or"  terms,  fitting  them  into  only  two  extreme  categories  instead  of  on  a  continuum.
    You  are  talking  about  your  thoughts  when  facing  a  situation  where  you  should  show  your  thinking  patterns!
    You  will  be  given  a  situation. I  need  you  to  generate  your  thoughts  that  best  align  with  your  thinking  patterns.
    Now  start  thinking,  organize  your  output  by  strictly  following  the  output  format  as  below:

    You  are  a  psychologist. You  are  talking  to  a  human-being  to  detect  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion.  You  should  detect  whether  he/she  has  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  or  not.  The  explanation  of  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  is:  one  views  a  situation,  a  person  or  an  event  in  "either-or"  terms,  fitting  them  into  only  two  extreme  categories  instead  of  on  a  continuum.

    Please  design  a  self-report  scale  with  {num_items}  questions  to  detect  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion.
    The  definition  of  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  is:  one  views  a  situation,  a  person  or  an  event  in  "either-or"  terms,  fitting  them  into  only  two  extreme  categories  instead  of  on  a  continuum..
    {scale_for_reference} You  can  refer  to  the  scale  above  and  design  a  new  scale  which  is  more  immersive  and  interactive.
    Please  generate  this  scale  in  the  following  format: Thoughts: <your  thoughts>
    Self-Report  Scale: “‘jsonl <scale  in  jsonl  format> “‘ — Each  line  in  the  generated  scale  is  in  format  like  {{"question":  "___?",  "options":  {{"___":1,  "___":  0}}}}  with  the  score  1  or  0  indicating  whether  the  user  has  all-or-nothing  cognitive  distortion  (=1)  or  not  (=0).</foreignobject></g></g></svg>'
