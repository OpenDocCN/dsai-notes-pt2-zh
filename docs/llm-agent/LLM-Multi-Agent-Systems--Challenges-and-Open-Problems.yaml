    that remain inadequately addressed. By leveraging the diverse capabilities and
    roles of individual agents within a multi-agent system, these systems can tackle
    complex tasks through collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering
    robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context
    information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions
    within multi-agent systems. We also explore the potential application of multi-agent
    systems in blockchain systems to shed light on their future development and application
    in real-world distributed systems.

    collaborations among agents and their specialized abilities (Talebirad & Nadiri,
    [2023](#bib.bib28); Zhang et al., [2023a](#bib.bib37); Park et al., [2023](#bib.bib25);
    Li et al., [2023](#bib.bib18); Jinxin et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)). It utilizing
    collaboration and coordination among agents to execute tasks that are beyond the
    capability of any individual agent. In multi-agent systems, each agent is equipped
    with distinctive capabilities and roles, collaborating towards the fulfillment
    of some common objectives. Such collaboration, characterized by activities such
    as debate and reflection, has proven particularly effective for tasks requiring
    deep thought and innovation. Recent works include simulating interactive environments (Park
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib25); Jinxin et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)), role-playing (Li
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib18)), reasoning (Du et al., [2023](#bib.bib9); Liang et al.,

    handling complex real-world scenarios.

    systems, the potential for advanced multi-agent systems far exceeds the progress
    made to date. A large number of existing works focus on devising planning strategies
    within a single agent by breaking down the tasks into smaller, more manageable
    tasks (Chen et al., [2022](#bib.bib6); Ziqi & Lu, [2023](#bib.bib40); Yao et al.,

    Wang et al., [2022b](#bib.bib33)). Yet, multi-agent systems involve agents of
    various specializations and more complex interactions and layered context information,
    which poses challenges to the designing of the work flow as well as the whole
    system. Also, existing literature pays limited attention to memory storage, while
    memory plays a critical role in collaborations between agents. It enables agents
    to access to some common sense, aligning context with their tasks, and further,
    learn from past work flows and adapt their strategies accordingly.

    role is to guide or plan, while the followers respond or execute based on the
    leader’s instructions. Hierarchical structures are prevalent in scenarios where
    coordinated efforts directed by a central authority are essential. Multi-agent
    systems that explore Stackelberg games (Von Stackelberg, [2010](#bib.bib30); Conitzer
    & Sandholm, [2006](#bib.bib8)) fall into this category (Harris et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)).
    This type of game is distinguished by this leadership-followership dynamic and

    down the tasks into small ones and construct a sub-system, either equi-level or
    hierarchical, and “invite” several agents to help with those tasks. In such systems,
    the interplay between different levels of hierarchy and peer-to-peer interaction

    strategic interactions in multi-agent systems, particularly for systems that involve
    complex interactions among agents such as debates or discussions. A crucial concept
    in game theory is equilibrium, e.g., Nash Equilibrium (Kreps, [1989](#bib.bib16))
    and Stackelberg Equilibrium (Von Stackelberg, [2010](#bib.bib30); Conitzer & Sandholm,
    [2006](#bib.bib8)), that describes a state where, given the strategies of others,
    no agent benefits from unilaterally changing their strategy. Game theory has been
    applied in multi-agent systems, especially Stackelberg equilibrium (Gerstgrasser
    & Parkes, [2023](#bib.bib10); Harris et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)), as the structure
    of Stackelberg equilibrium contains is a leader agent and multiple follower agents,
    and such hierarchical architectures are wildely considered in multi-agent systems.
    As an example, (Gerstgrasser & Parkes, [2023](#bib.bib10)) designs a general multi-agent
    framework to identify Stackelberg Equilibrium in Markov games, and (Harris et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib14)) extend the Stackelberg model to allow agents to consider external
    context information, such as traffic and weather, etc. However, some problems
    are still challenging in multi-agent systems, such as defining an appropriate
    payoff structure for both the collective strategy and individual agents based
    on the context of the overall tasks, and efficiently achieving equilibrium states.
    These unresolved issues highlight the ongoing need for refinement in the application
    of game theory to complex multi-agent scenarios.

    have varied functionalities and access needs. Some agents may have to query their
    sensitive data, but they don’t want such data to be accessed by other parties.
    While ensuring the consensus memory to be accessible to all clients, implementing
    robust access control mechanisms is crucial to ensure sensitive information of
    an agent is not accessible to all agents. Additionally, as the agents in a system
    collaborative on one task, and their functionalities share same contexts, their
    external data storage and memories may overlap. If the data and functionalities
    of these agents are not sensitive, adopting an unified data storage can effectively
    manage redundancy among the data, and furthermore, ensure consistency across the
    multi-agent system, leading to more efficient and precise maintenance of memory.'

    as sophisticated tools for various tasks on blockchain and Web3 systems. Also,
    blockchain nodes can be viewed as agents with specific roles and capabilities (Ankile
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib2)). Given that both Blockchain systems and multi-agent
    systems are inherently distributed, the blockchain networks can be integrated
    with multi-agent systems seamlessly. By assigning a dedicated agent to each blockchain
    node, it’s possible to enhance data analyzing and processing while bolstering

    execute the terms of a contract between a buyer and a seller in a blockchain system.
    The codes are fixed, and are self-executed when predetermined conditions are met.
    Multi-agent systems can automate and optimize the execution of smart contracts
    with more flexible terms and even dynamic external information from users. Agents
    can negotiate contract terms on behalf of their users, manage contract execution,
    and even optimize gas fees (in the context of Ethereum (Wood et al., [2014](#bib.bib35)).
    The agents can analyze context information , such as past actions and pre-defined
    criteria, and utilize the information with more flexibility. Such negotiations
    can also utilize game theory, such as Stackelberg Equilibrium (Von Stackelberg,
    [2010](#bib.bib30); Conitzer & Sandholm, [2006](#bib.bib8)) when there is a leader
    negotiator and Nash Equilibrium (Kreps, [1989](#bib.bib16)) when there is no leader.

- en: The exploration of multi-agent systems in this paper underscores their significant
    potential in advancing the capabilities of LLM agents beyond the confines of single-agent
    paradigms. By leveraging the specialized abilities and collaborative dynamics
    among agents, multi-agent systems can tackle complex tasks with enhanced efficiency
    and innovation. Our study has illuminated challenges that need to be addressed
    to harness the power of multi-agent systems better, including optimizing task
    planning, managing complex context information, and improving memory management.
    Furthermore, the potential applications of multi-agent systems in blockchain technologies
    reveal new avenues for development, which suggests a promising future for these
    systems in distributed computing environments.
