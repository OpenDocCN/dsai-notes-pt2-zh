- en: Linear programming (LP) problems are pervasive in real-life applications. However,
    despite their apparent simplicity, an untrained user may find it difficult to
    determine the linear model of their specific problem. We envisage the creation
    of a goal-oriented conversational agent that will engage in conversation with
    the user to elicit all information required so that a subsequent agent can generate
    the linear model. In this paper, we present an approach for the generation of
    sample dialogues that can be used to develop and train such a conversational agent.
    Using prompt engineering, we develop two agents that “talk” to each other, one
    acting as the conversational agent, and the other acting as the user. Using a
    set of text descriptions of linear problems from NL4Opt available to the user
    only, the agent and the user engage in conversation until the agent has retrieved
    all key information from the original problem description. We also propose an
    extrinsic evaluation of the dialogues by assessing how well the summaries generated
    by the dialogues match the original problem descriptions. We conduct human and
    automatic evaluations, including an evaluation approach that uses GPT-4 to mimic
    the human evaluation metrics. The evaluation results show an overall good quality
    of the dialogues, though research is still needed to improve the quality of the
    GPT-4 evaluation metrics. The resulting dialogues, including the human annotations
    of a subset, are available to the research community. The conversational agent
    used for the generation of the dialogues can be used as a baseline.

- en: Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical optimization technique widely employed
    to address a multitude of real-world challenges, ranging from resource allocation
    in supply chain management to portfolio optimization in finance. Despite the ubiquity
    of LP problems and their practical importance, many individuals, particularly
    those without specialized mathematical backgrounds, often struggle to formulate
    the appropriate linear models for their specific problem instances. This barrier
    hinders the broader utilization of LP techniques, especially among non-experts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To mitigate this challenge, we propose the development of a goal-oriented conversational
    agent capable of assisting users in constructing accurate linear models for their
    unique problem scenarios. This conversational agent would engage users in a dialogue,
    eliciting relevant information pertaining to the problem, and subsequently generate
    the corresponding linear model. This paper focuses on an essential aspect of creating
    such an agent –– the generation of synthetic dialogues that can be employed to
    train and evaluate the conversational agent’s performance.

    one simulating the conversational agent’s behavior, and the other emulating the
    user’s responses during problem-solving interactions. The agents are designed
    to engage in purposeful dialogues aimed at extracting the necessary information
    from the user to construct a valid linear model. To facilitate this process, we
    utilize a set of text descriptions of linear problems, accessible only to the
    user agent, sourced from the NL4Opt dataset Ramamonjison et al. ([2022](#bib.bib9),
    [2023](#bib.bib10)). These text descriptions serve as the basis for the dialogues
    and enable the conversational agent to iteratively gather the critical information
    required for problem formulation.'

    for assessing the quality and effectiveness of the generated dialogues. Specifically,
    we evaluate how well the summaries generated by the dialogues align with the original
    problem descriptions from NL4Opt. This evaluation encompasses both human assessments,
    where human judges evaluate the quality of dialogue summaries, and automated metrics
    to quantitatively measure the informativeness of the generated summaries.

- en: The dialogues for a subset of 28 LP problems were evaluated using an extrinsic
    evaluation that judged whether summaries generated by the dialogues matched the
    key information from the original problem descriptions. The evaluation was conducted
    by human evaluators and automatically. Among the automatic evaluation metrics,
    besides well-known automatic metrics ROUGE and BERTScore, we designed another
    GPT-4 agent that mimicked the human evaluators. The results indicate a reasonable
    correlation between ROUGE L, BERTScore P, and the average human information precision
    scores, and this is slightly better than the correlation between the GPT4 agent
    and the human IP scores.

- en: As further work, we intend to refine the prompts used for the evaluation approach
    with GPT-4\. In addition, we will conduct more exhaustive types of evaluation
    on the data set that might be more suitable to the specific domain of linear programming
    modeling. In particular, we plan to analyse the generated dialogues at the level
    of the dialogue turns.
