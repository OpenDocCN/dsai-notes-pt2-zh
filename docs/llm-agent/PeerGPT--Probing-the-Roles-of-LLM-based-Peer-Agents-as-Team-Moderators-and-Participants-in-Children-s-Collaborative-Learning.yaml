- en: In children’s collaborative learning, effective peer conversations can significantly
    enhance the quality of children’s collaborative interactions. The integration
    of Large Language Model (LLM) agents into this setting explores their novel role
    as peers, assessing impacts as team moderators and participants. We invited two
    groups of participants to engage in a collaborative learning workshop, where they
    discussed and proposed conceptual solutions to a design problem. The peer conversation
    transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. We discovered that peer agents,
    while managing discussions effectively as team moderators, sometimes have their
    instructions disregarded. As participants, they foster children’s creative thinking
    but may not consistently provide timely feedback. These findings highlight potential
    design improvements and considerations for peer agents in both roles.

- en: In the context of children’s collaborative learning, it has been demonstrated
    that positive peer interactions not only enhance learning outcomes (Rohrbeck et al.,
    [2003](#bib.bib27)), but also cultivate their social and emotional competence
    (Hay et al., [2004](#bib.bib13)) and communication capability (Veldman et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib33)). Peer conversations, as an important aspect within the interactive
    process, are crucial for the effectiveness of the interaction (Mercer et al.,
    [1999](#bib.bib22)). Advancements in AI, especially in Large Language Models (LLMs)
    like ChatGPT with transformer architecture (Hancock et al., [2020](#bib.bib12)),
    are enhancing human communication by effectively simulating natural language interactions
    (Brown et al., [2020](#bib.bib7)).

- en: Prior research has explored the integration of conversational agents in interactions
    with children (Aeschlimann et al., [2020](#bib.bib2)). In the context of education,
    pedagogical conversational agents play a pivotal role in facilitating rich learning
    interactions, serving as an effective means of intervention in children’s learning
    processes (Pérez-Marín, [2021a](#bib.bib24)), and impacting learners’ emotional
    experiences (Kim et al., [2007a](#bib.bib16)). Existing research has discussed
    the roles of conversational agents as teachers or learning facilitators, and a
    few studies also explored their role as peers (Pérez-Marín, [2021a](#bib.bib24)).
    However, the majority of this research implies the one-on-one child-agent interaction
    in learning (Khosrawi-Rad et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)). Research on designing peer
    agents in children’s collaborative learning, especially in peer conversations,
    is limited, with the impact of different roles like team moderator or participant
    on these conversations still largely unexplored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our pilot study aims to preliminarily explore this less-addressed opportunity.
    Namely, we conducted two design-based collaborative learning workshops with children.
    Six child participants, aged 11-12, were randomly assigned to different peer roles
    and collaborated to address ”urban and environmental design challenges in 2050”,
    creating relevant design solutions. An LLM-based peer agent, hereinafter referred
    to as ’peer agent’. participated as a team member in each of the two workshops,
    respectively playing the role of a team moderator or a participant, engaging in
    dialogues with other children as their learning collaboration unfolded. The peer
    agent consisted of OpenAI ’s GPT-3.5 and voice output devices. The agent’s roles
    were established through iteratively designed and user-validated prompts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for a qualitative
    thematic analysis to explore how the agent, in its dual roles, influenced peer
    conversations, encompassing both agent-children and children-children conversations.
    The research findings indicate that peer agent exhibits distinct advantages and
    challenges in both roles. When functioning as a moderator in children’s discussions,
    peer agent can relatively effectively control the pace and structure of the discussion.
    However, it is prone to lacking authority, resulting in some children overlooking
    its guidance or instruction. In the other case, when peer agent acts as a team
    participant, its responses could stimulate children’s creative thinking and supplement
    their knowledge gaps. In this situation, the timeliness of the agent’s responses
    to the evolving collaborative dynamics is vital. Additionally, the agent’s verbal
    input during the prototyping phase may pose challenges, as children tend to focus
    more on nonverbal aspects of collaboration.

- en: Collaborative learning refers to members actively engaging in activities or
    tasks within a group, fostering children’s reasoning abilities (Celepkolu et al.,
    [2021](#bib.bib9)). The goal is to collectively solve problems through cooperation
    (Randi A. Engle and de Royston, [2014](#bib.bib26)). Conversations among peers
    play a pivotal role in affording the effectiveness of collaborative learning (Samrose
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib28)). Over the past few decades, numerous scholars have
    conducted research on peer interactions, with a substantial amount of learning-based
    interactions and conversations occurring in educational settings (Cazden, [1988](#bib.bib8)).
    Peer conversations among children in collaborative learning serve as primary venues
    for the development of children’s communication and collaboration abilities, providing
    them with extensive opportunities for interactive learning and social development
    (Blum-Kulka and Snow, [2004](#bib.bib5); McTear, [1985](#bib.bib21)).

    to assessing their potential pragmatic and conversational skills (Stude, [2014](#bib.bib31)).
    However, the majority of existing research has taken place within the field of
    linguistics and education. There remains a limited exploration of children’s peer
    conversation abilities in human-computer interaction design. Potential research
    on how to facilitate peer conversations through HCI designs is an important avenue
    that requires further investigation.

    others can enhance the quality and trust of these interactions (Wertsch, [1984](#bib.bib34);
    Shin et al., [2023](#bib.bib29)). Previous studies have introduced additional
    roles into peer conversation processes (Tomasello et al., [2012](#bib.bib32)),
    leading to positive emotional experiences for learners (Kim et al., [2007b](#bib.bib17)).

    in bidirectional dialogues (Zheng et al., [2022](#bib.bib36)), which are considered
    effective tools for assisting children in the learning process (Pérez-Marín, [2021b](#bib.bib25)).
    They can engage and understand the learners. (Kuhail et al., [2023](#bib.bib19);
    Cunningham-Nelson et al., [2019](#bib.bib10)). Conversational agents can assume
    various roles when interacting with students in classroom, such as tutors and
    peers. As tutors, agents establish rules and guide children through specific tasks.
    (Pérez-Marín, [2021b](#bib.bib25)). As peers, they focus more on equality (Dimitrova
    et al., [2009](#bib.bib11)) and emotional feedback (Kim and Baylor, [2016](#bib.bib18))to
    enhance children’s learning capabilities (Bishop, [1998](#bib.bib4)). In children’s
    collaborative activities, current studies primarily focus on the role of agents
    as assistants or tutors, with a emphasis on the impact of agents on learning outcomes
    and abilities (Khosrawi-Rad et al., [2023](#bib.bib15); Hayashi, [2020](#bib.bib14)).
    Research on the role of conversational agents as peers in collaborative learning
    and their influence on peer conversations is relatively scarce. Hence, the question
    of what peer role that conversational agents should assume in children’s collaborative
    learning, and in what manner to better influence peer conversations becomes a
    research question worthy of further exploration.

    and agents. As a moderator, the peer agent can effectively control the process
    of discussions.But when providing lengthy information, it may be overlooked. In
    the other case, when as a participant , it can encourage children to contemplate
    agent’s statements, provide the knowledge they may lack (Allal and Ducrey, [2000](#bib.bib3)).

- en: Furthermore, we observed that timely perception and feedback on children’s peer
    conversations are crucial in both scenarios(Pérez-Marín, [2021b](#bib.bib25))
    , especially during the first two phases of the workshop. This implies that peer
    agent influences peer conversations not only through its direct suggestions but
    also shapes the choice and depth of topics. Our research provides insights into
    the influence of peer agent in different roles on children’s collaborative learning
    conversations, offering a novel perspective distinct from prior studies that predominantly
    concentrated on the roles of peer agent as assistants or tutors (Pérez-Marín,
    [2021b](#bib.bib25)), additionally,our research offer practical recommendations
    for the design of peer agents based on specific peer roles.

    role on peer conversations in children’s collaborative learning, providing insights
    can inform the design of larger-scale experiments. For instance, agents capable
    of providing timely feedback for children’s creative activities (Zhang et al.,
    [2024](#bib.bib35)). However, this research has some limitations. Firstly, the
    small sample size could limit the generalizability of the result . Secondly, the
    study adopted an inter-group comparison approach to avoid cognitive redundancy,
    which made it challenging to contrast the effects of different roles for the peer
    agent through intra-group comparisons. Lastly, the design application of peer
    agent in our study are preliminary, need improvement in terms of language feedback
    effectiveness and appearance.Future work aims to address the limitations of this
    study, refine the experimental design. Additionally, future research seeks to
    explore more dimensions of how peer agents influence peer conversations, including
    aspects related to non-verbal interactions.
