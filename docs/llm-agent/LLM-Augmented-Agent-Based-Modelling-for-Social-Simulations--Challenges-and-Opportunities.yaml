    better integration into agent-based simulations offers a transformational potential
    for understanding complex social systems. However, such integration is not trivial
    and poses numerous challenges. Based on this observation, in this paper, we explore
    architectures and methods to systematically develop LLM-augmented social simulations
    and discuss potential research directions in this field. We conclude that integrating
    LLMs with agent-based simulations offers a powerful toolset for researchers and
    scientists, allowing for more nuanced, realistic, and comprehensive models of
    complex systems and human behaviours.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced a rapid expansion in adoption
    across a multitude of research domains and practical applications in recently.
    This swift proliferation is largely attributed to their remarkable ability in
    understanding, generating, and translating human language with unprecedented accuracy
    and fluency. Industries ranging from healthcare [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2)],
    where they assist in patient care and medical research, to finance [[3](#bib.bib3)],
    for analyzing market trends and automating customer service, have leveraged the
    capabilities of LLMs to enhance efficiency and innovation. Furthermore, in the
    realm of academia, these models are instrumental in analyzing vast datasets for
    insights [[4](#bib.bib4)], thereby accelerating research outcomes in fields such
    as social sciences, linguistics, and computer science. The versatility and evolving
    sophistication of LLMs have thus cemented their role as a cornerstone technology
    that is reshaping the landscape of both industry and research, fostering new methodologies
    and approaches across disciplines.

    simulations [[5](#bib.bib5)]. Social simulations are used to model and analyze
    the complex interactions within social systems, including factors like individual
    behaviours, group dynamics, social norms, and institutional structures. These
    simulations aim to understand, predict, or examine hypothetical scenarios within
    social systems. In that sense, a technique used for social simulations is agent-based
    modelling (ABM). ABM is used to design and simulate the actions and interactions
    of autonomous agents (individuals, entities, or organizations) to assess their
    effects on the system as a whole. ABM can utilize AI techniques to enhance the
    models’ complexity, adaptability, and realism. So far, ABM has already practically
    incorporated AI techniques like Machine Learning (ML) [[6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7),
    [8](#bib.bib8), [9](#bib.bib9)], Reinforcement Learning [[10](#bib.bib10), [11](#bib.bib11)]
    and Inverse Reinforcement Learning [[12](#bib.bib12)] in various social simulation
    studies. However, the potential of LLMs in assisting in understanding of complex
    social systems has yet to be realized. There are few studies focusing on such
    incorporation recently. Even though these studies provide some practical solutions,
    they lack a well-defined conceptual baseline which is necessary to explore general-purpose
    architectures and methodologies – eventually extending existing ones – that are
    effective to seamlessly and systematically integrate social simulations and LLMs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, LLMs can streamline and augment various other aspects of the ABM
    process, such as literature reviewing, data preparation and interpretation, calibration
    of parameters, sensitivity analyses, analyses of results. We have already begun
    to see some impacts of LLMs on these activities. But they are scarce and do not
    provide a clear vision in terms of social simulations. Drawing upon these observations,
    in this paper, we outline prospective avenues for research into the augmentation
    of agent-based simulations through the integration of LLMs. We articulate a structured
    exploration of the symbiotic potential between LLMs and ABM frameworks, aiming
    to advance the methodological foundations and enhance the analytical capabilities
    of social simulations.

    an endless array of characters. Essentially, LLMs can be fine-tuned by exposing
    them to specific roles so that they can simulate human-like interactions. Fine-tuning
    is achieved by training the model on a curated dataset that embodies the language,
    knowledge, and nuances of the roles it is expected to perform. This process involves
    adjusting the model’s parameters so it better aligns with the patterns, vocabulary,
    and decision-making processes characteristic of the target roles. During fine-tuning,
    the model learns to prioritize responses that reflect the specific traits, expertise,
    or persona of the roles in question. This is often done by using a smaller, more
    specialized dataset after the model has been pre-trained on a broad corpus of
    text, allowing it to adapt its vast general knowledge to more narrowly defined
    contexts and behaviors. However, such dataset as well can be relatively large.

    relatively large datasets is called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [[16](#bib.bib16)].
    In this architecture, the dataset is broken into chunks (such as a couple of paragraphs
    or a page) and then those chunks are sent to an LLM and they are turned into a
    vector. Each chunk will have a vector (i.e. a series of numbers) which a numeric
    representation of the essence of that chunk. After, each time right after a prompt
    is sent, its vector is calculated as well using the same LLM. Then, the closest
    chunks are found by performing a mathematical comparison between the chunk vectors
    and the prompt vector. Finally, these chunks are used as part of the prompt.

    systems through computational simulations [[17](#bib.bib17)]. Social systems,
    in this context, refer to complex networks of interactions among individuals,
    institutions, and their environments (which can include factors like individual
    behaviours, group dynamics, social norms, and institutional structures). The multifaceted
    nature of social systems allows individuals to play multiple roles simultaneously
    (such as a parent, employee, consumer, and citizen in a human society) each with
    its own set of expectations and norms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ABM for social systems aims to mimic social processes by simulating the actions
    and interactions of agents, which represent individuals or entities within these
    systems, to predict and understand complex phenomena. In other words, ABM enhances
    the study of social systems by offering a bottom-up modeling approach, where the
    macro-level phenomena of interest emerge from the micro-level interactions of
    agents. This capability is invaluable in social science, where understanding the
    emergence of complex social phenomena from simple rules of interaction can provide
    profound insights into the nature of social order, the evolution of norms and
    institutions, and the dynamics of social change. Social simulations provide a
    powerful means to examine hypothetical scenarios, test theories of social behavior
    and interaction, and explore the potential effects of policy decisions without
    the ethical and practical constraints of real-world experimentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, analyzing the results of ABM to understand social systems presents
    several challenges, primarily due to the complexity and dynamism inherent in both
    the models and the systems they seek to represent. Firstly, ABMs often generate
    vast amounts of data through the simulation of interactions among numerous agents
    over time, making it difficult to discern clear patterns or draw straightforward
    conclusions. The emergent phenomena, a hallmark of ABM, while valuable for understanding
    the macro-level outcomes of micro-level behaviors, can complicate analysis as
    these outcomes are not always predictable or linear. Secondly, interpreting the
    results of ABMs in a manner that is meaningful for policy-making or theoretical
    advancement requires bridging the gap between complex, often technical, model
    outputs and the conceptual frameworks of social sciences. This often demands interdisciplinary
    collaboration to ensure that the insights generated are both scientifically rigorous
    and socially relevant.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides, in addition to ABM, social scientists employ various other methods
    to study social systems. Surveys and questionnaires are used to collect large-scale
    data on individual attitudes, behaviours, and experiences. Interviews and ethnography
    offer in-depth qualitative insights into social phenomena, capturing the nuances
    of human behaviour and social interactions. Case studies provide detailed analysis
    of specific instances or events, allowing for a deep understanding of complex
    social processes. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs are utilized to
    establish causal relationships between variables. Statistical analysis and computational
    techniques, including network analysis and data mining, are applied to analyze
    and model large datasets. Lastly, content and discourse analysis are employed
    to examine communication patterns and the construction of meaning within social
    contexts. Some of these methods are already used in ABM studies.

    potential for understanding complex social systems. However, such integration
    requires a conceptual baseline to connect both domains. A conceptual baseline
    is a clear and coherent foundational framework that outlines key concepts, variables,
    assumptions, and relationships within a given system or model. It serves as a
    reference point for understanding the dynamics and behaviour of the system being
    studied, and it is subsequently used for model development and analysis. Such
    a conceptual baseline can be established using the existing engineering methodologies
    dedicated to multi-agent systems (MAS). A MAS is typically viewed from four primary
    angles: agent, interaction, environment and organization.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Agent-oriented methodologies prioritize individual agents, their autonomy, internal
    states, and decision-making [[18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20)].
    They use the Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) model for agent cognition
    and define agents’ capabilities and roles. This approach enables detailed modeling
    of complex, autonomous agents that make decisions based on perceptions and fulfill
    roles in multi-agent interactions. Interaction-oriented methodologies focus on
    agent communication and coordination dynamics, using protocols and messages to
    define interaction patterns [[21](#bib.bib21), [22](#bib.bib22), [23](#bib.bib23)].
    Protocols ensure structured information exchanges, while negotiation and coordination
    mechanisms support joint decision-making and action synchronization. Social norms
    and conventions establish a framework for predictable interactions and adherence
    to shared conduct rules. Environment-oriented methodologies emphasize the environment’s
    role in agent interactions, focusing on shared resources, stigmergy for indirect
    coordination, and affordances that dictate agent actions based on their capabilities
    [[24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25)]. Organizational-oriented methodologies abstract
    the MAS regarding groups, teams, and broader organizational structures [[26](#bib.bib26),
    [27](#bib.bib27), [28](#bib.bib28), [29](#bib.bib29), [30](#bib.bib30), [31](#bib.bib31),
    [32](#bib.bib32)]. These methodologies focus on how agents are arranged and interact
    within larger entities, defining roles, responsibilities, and relationships through
    groups and teams. Organizational structures, such as hierarchies or networks,
    dictate the flow of information and control among agents. Policies and regulations
    set out the rules governing behaviour within the organization, guiding agent actions
    and interactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The organizational-oriented MAS approach is particularly well-suited for modeling
    social systems and integrating LLMs due to its emphasis on structured interactions
    and roles within a complex system. This approach mirrors the hierarchical and
    networked nature of social systems, where entities (agents) assume specific roles
    and responsibilities that are governed by established norms and policies. Such
    an organizational structure enables the clear definition of roles for LLMs, facilitating
    their integration as agents with specific functions related to language understanding,
    generation, and processing. This not only enhances the system’s ability to mimic
    human social structures but also leverages LLMs’ capabilities in natural language
    processing to improve communication and coordination among agents. By aligning
    the structural and functional aspects of MAS with the inherent properties of social
    systems and the strengths of LLMs, the organizational-oriented approach offers
    a robust framework for capturing the complexity and dynamics of social interactions,
    making it a superior choice for these applications. Therefore, we claim that an
    efficient ABM tool augmented by LLM should support the organization-oriented conceptual
    baseline.

    that are role-playing one or several predefined characters [[33](#bib.bib33),
    [34](#bib.bib34), [35](#bib.bib35)]. A social agent’s skills are the role playing
    capacities they have through their interactions with environments, and are used
    in a community of other role players who also inhabit in these environments.

    the issue of information overload, enabling them to quickly identify relevant
    studies without compromising the breadth or depth of the review. Their ability

    to simulate a synthetic population of a vast array of social agents representing
    human experiences and perspectives [[45](#bib.bib45)], which can provide a more
    precise depiction of human behavior and social dynamics than what is achievable

    judgements quite well aligned with human judgements [[48](#bib.bib48)]. The information
