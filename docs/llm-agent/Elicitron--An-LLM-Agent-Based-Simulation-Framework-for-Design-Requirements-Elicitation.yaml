  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Requirements elicitation, a critical, yet time-consuming and challenging step
    in product development, often fails to capture the full spectrum of user needs.
    This may lead to products that fall short of expectations. This paper introduces
    a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and
    enhance the requirements elicitation process.  LLMs are used to generate a vast
    array of simulated users (LLM agents), enabling the exploration of a much broader
    range of user needs and unforeseen use cases. These agents engage in product experience
    scenarios, through explaining their actions, observations, and challenges. Subsequent
    agent interviews and analysis uncover valuable user needs, including latent ones.
    We validate our framework with three experiments. First, we explore different
    methodologies for diverse agent generation, discussing their advantages and shortcomings. We
    measure the diversity of identified user needs and demonstrate that context-aware
    agent generation leads to greater diversity. Second, we show how our framework
    effectively mimics empathic lead user interviews, identifying a greater number
    of latent needs than conventional human interviews. Third, we showcase that LLMs
    can be used to analyze interviews, capture needs, and classify them as latent
    or not. Our work highlights the potential of using LLM agents to accelerate early-stage
    product development, reduce costs, and increase innovation.

- en: Requirements elicitation (RE) sits at the core of successful product design,
    yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive endeavor. Traditional RE methods,
    like interviews, focus groups, and prototyping, are invaluable but have inherent
    limitations. These methods are often time-consuming, may not fully capture the
    diversity of user perspectives, and may miss underlying needs that are difficult
    for users to articulate [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2)]. The consequences of
    inadequate requirements elicitation can be significant, ranging from design misalignment
    to compromised product adoption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new possibilities
    for automating and augmenting requirements elicitation. LLMs, having learned the
    patterns and complexities of human language from vast textual corpora, seemingly
    possess a remarkable capacity for natural language understanding [[3](#bib.bib3)].
    This potential can be leveraged to construct a simulated environment where LLM
    agents *role-play* a variety of potential users. These agents can embody distinct
    viewpoints, engage in product experience scenarios, and participate in user interviews
    aimed at identifying user needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This research presents a new LLM-based framework, called Elicitron, for automating
    and augmenting the RE process. In Elicitron, LLM agents are constrained to produce
    structured outputs that are relevant to and useful for the requirement elicitation
    process. Elicitron also employs techniques to create diverse user-representing
    agents and simulate product experiences through the *Action, Observation, Challenge*
    steps, inspired by *chain-of-thought* reasoning [[4](#bib.bib4)]. Lastly, by creating
    agents with specific roles, Elicitron can discover interesting user needs that
    may otherwise be difficult to obtain with human interviews.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Elictron’s ability to create diverse user agents can be leveraged to identify
    a diverse set of user needs. Because the process of creating and interviewing
    these agents is automated, the process is highly scalable, unlike the traditional
    RE methods. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the capability of Elicitron
    to generate a diverse set of user needs and identified a context-aware generation
    method that maximizes needs diversity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, we show how Elicitron can be applied to identify latent needs –
    those unarticulated and unexpected factors that strongly influence product desirability [[5](#bib.bib5)]
    – which is significantly difficult to obtain with the traditional RE methods. This
    can be achieved by either automatically or manually creating user agents with
    *empathic lead user* roles [[6](#bib.bib6)]. We conduct a second experiment to
    demonstrate that Elicitron can generate a higher number of latent needs than human
    interviews. Our third experiment shows that, given a criteria and chain-of-thought
    reasoning, LLMs are capable to identifying and classifying latent needs within
    interview data.

- en: There are reasons to believe LLMs could offer unique advantages for identifying
    diverse and latent needs. The core capabilities of LLMs lie in their flexibility
    and ability to perform different tasks related to natural language. Their inclusion
    of contextual elements greatly improves their performance and result in them appearing
    to pick up on nuances and inferences. Because LLMs have been trained on a vast
    amount of data, they likely have been exposed to a diverse set of user needs for
    a particular product. During training, LLM’s may have also picked up behavioral
    patterns and subtle language cues that hint at underlying–sometimes even subconscious–needs
    experienced by users. Moreover, it may be able to perform analogical reasoning
    to relate experiences and needs identified across different products and uncover
    novel needs.

- en: 'However, a potential contradiction arises when considering the inherent nature
    of LLMs: They are trained to predict the most likely next word or sequence of
    words based on patterns in their training data [[7](#bib.bib7)]. On the surface,
    this focus on selecting the most likely outcome might seem at odds with the goal
    of uncovering diverse or latent needs. In practice, LLMs do not always select
    the next word or phrase greedily due to certain hyper-parameters (such as temperature
    or top-P) allowing for some randomness. Furthermore, the context provided to the
    LLM, in the form of input text that the model considers when generating a response,
    can heavily influence its output. Through careful contextualization, we can encourage
    the LLM to move beyond the obvious outputs and for our purpose, produce outputs
    that help the designer discover diverse and latent needs.'

    interviewing, observing, and empathizing with users, designers can derive structured
    design requirements from unstructured feedback from product users, in a process

    sight or oven mittens to simulate limited dexterity [[6](#bib.bib6)]. Issa et

    with [specific experience]”, in an attempt to bias the designer to be more empathetic
    with a lead user [[25](#bib.bib25)]. More recently, Zhu et al. theorized how artificial

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In design methodology literature, design diversity is typically considered the
    extension of novelty from a set of designs. A novel design is often considered
    to be unique by the person who created it (psychological novelty), or more generally
    unique to the field (historical novelty) [[31](#bib.bib31)]. Evaluating the novelty
    of a design is a subjective task, and it is typical to leverage Consensual Assessment
    Technique (CAT) or similar methods that involve asking domain experts to rate
    designs on criteria such as novelty [[32](#bib.bib32), [33](#bib.bib33), [34](#bib.bib34),
    [35](#bib.bib35)]. However, recent work in deep generative models, which leverages
    machine learning methods trained on large datasets of prior designs to create
    novel design solutions, has led to the development and adoption of computational
    novelty and diversity metrics. These include the convex hull volume and the mean
    distance to centroid metrics, which can be used to measure the average diversity
    of a whole set of designs [[36](#bib.bib36), [37](#bib.bib37), [38](#bib.bib38),
    [39](#bib.bib39), [40](#bib.bib40), [41](#bib.bib41), [42](#bib.bib42), [43](#bib.bib43)]. In
    addition to those measures, we are also interested in measuring the diversity
    of possible clusters of design ideas, and not just the outliers, thus the silhouette
    score typically used in cluster analysis [[44](#bib.bib44)] may also be applicable.

    set that includes all of the samples. It has been used to measure the diversity
    in different disciplines, but is sensitive to outliers [[36](#bib.bib36), [37](#bib.bib37),
    [45](#bib.bib45)]. A larger convex hull volume indicates that, in the embedding
    space, the samples cover more space and are more diverse.

    of each sample to the centroid of the whole set [[36](#bib.bib36), [37](#bib.bib37),
    [46](#bib.bib46), [47](#bib.bib47)]. A larger value indicates that the samples
    in the set are further from the centroid, and thus are assumed to represent more
    diverse concepts. This metric is more suitable for more uniform distributions,
    and is also sensitive to outliers.

    to calculate the performance of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from
    -1 to 1, where a high value indicates that the object is well-matched to its own
    cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. The silhouette score has been
    used to measure the diversity of recommendation systems, but has not been adopted
    in the field of design research [[48](#bib.bib48), [49](#bib.bib49)].

    steering prompt can eliminate the need to manually create ELU agents. In fact,
    many of the user agents created in Condition 2 are similar to the ELU agents manually
    created in Condition 3\. Examples include those who are outside of the typical

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cost is an important consideration in latent needs identification studies, and
    the use of LLMs can be a cost-effective alternative. For example, GPT-4-Turbo,
    which was used in this study, costs 10 USD per 1 million input tokens and 30 USD
    per 1 million output tokens. This resulted in minimal costs for Experiments 1
    and 3, amounting to just a few cents, while Experiment 2, which involved generating
    approximately 80,000 tokens, incurred a total cost of around 2.4 USD. These costs
    are significantly lower than those associated with traditional user studies and
    surveys, which often require substantial investments in participant recruitment,
    compensation, and data analysis. The cost-effectiveness of using LLMs for latent
    needs identification has important implications for the scalability and accessibility
    of this research, enabling researchers and organizations with limited budgets
    to conduct comprehensive studies and obtain valuable insights at a fraction of
    the cost of conventional methods.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This paper presents Elicitron, a framework that leverages LLMs to enhance requirements
    elicitation and uncover diverse user needs, including those that are latent. Our
    context-aware serial generation method proved most effective in creating diverse
    user agents. Elicitron successfully outperformed traditional empathic lead user
    interviews in generating latent needs. LLMs also demonstrate effectiveness in
    analyzing interviews and classifying latent needs. Elicitron shows the potential
    of leveraging LLMs for requirements elicitation and user-centered design, providing
    an alternative and cost-effective method for designers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Elicitron shows promise, the quality of insights depends on the LLM’s
    capabilities, and prioritizing latent needs remains a designer’s task. Future
    work includes user studies to validate Elicitron’s ability to aid designers and
    exploring multi-agent interactions to uncover broader unmet needs. Moreover, exploring
    the possibility of incorporating multimodal inputs and outputs in the process
    of eliciting requirements represents another prospective avenue for research.
