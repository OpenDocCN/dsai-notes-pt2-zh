  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recently, LLM-powered driver agents have demonstrated considerable potential
    in the field of autonomous driving, showcasing human-like reasoning and decision-making
    abilities. However, current research on aligning driver agent behaviors with human
    driving styles remains limited, partly due to the scarcity of high-quality natural
    language data from human driving behaviors. To address this research gap, we propose
    a multi-alignment framework designed to align driver agents with human driving
    styles through demonstrations and feedback. Notably, we construct a natural language
    dataset of human driver behaviors through naturalistic driving experiments and
    post-driving interviews, offering high-quality human demonstrations for LLM alignment.
    The framework’s effectiveness is validated through simulation experiments in the
    CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human evaluations. Our
    research offers valuable insights into designing driving agents with diverse driving
    styles. The implementation of [the framework](https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Multi-alignment-Drivng-Agent)¹¹1[https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Multi-alignment-Drivng-Agent](https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Multi-alignment-Drivng-Agent)

- en: In the burgeoning field of autonomous driving (AV), driver agents powered by
    Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating remarkable promise due to their
    exceptional planning[[1](#bib.bib1)] and reasoning[[2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3),
    [4](#bib.bib4)] capabilities. Researchers have delved into the development of
    intricately designed driver agents that could perceive environmental stimuli[[5](#bib.bib5),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7)], comprehend the situation[[8](#bib.bib8)], fetch
    their memories[[9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)] and deduce subsequent driving
    actions[[11](#bib.bib11)] that mirrors human decision-making. Such human-like
    AVs show promise in navigating a diverse range of driving scenarios [[12](#bib.bib12),
    [13](#bib.bib13)], enabling better anticipation of AV behavior by other road users [[14](#bib.bib14)],
    while also enhancing human trust in these systems [[15](#bib.bib15)].

- en: However, aligning these driver agents with human driving styles to imbue them
    with more human-like and personalized characteristics remains unexplored. Prevailing
    strategies for aligning LLM-based agents with humans, such as fine-tuning[[5](#bib.bib5),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [16](#bib.bib16)] and the integration of expert feedback[[17](#bib.bib17),
    [18](#bib.bib18)], are often hindered by their high costs. Recently, some studies
    have leveraged AI to generate feedback or reflections[[19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20),
    [21](#bib.bib21), [22](#bib.bib22)], yet they fall short in aligning such reflections
    with human perspectives. On the other hand, despite researches focusing on employing
    AI to generate few-shot demonstrations[[1](#bib.bib1), [23](#bib.bib23)] for LLMs,
    another challenge in enhancing agent-human alignment lies in the lack of high-quality
    human behavior data in a form accessible to LLMs, making it difficult for agents
    to learn from human demonstrations. Existing datasets for autonomous driving learning
    either provide only environment data for perception tasks[[24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25),
    [26](#bib.bib26)] rather than driving behaviors, or present driving behaviors
    in non-linguistic modalities (e.g. trajectories in maps[[27](#bib.bib27)], Controller
    Area Network Bus (CAN-Bus) data[[28](#bib.bib28), [29](#bib.bib29)], in-car videos[[30](#bib.bib30)])
    that are indirect for LLMs to learn from. Thus, successful alignment requires
    an approach that efficiently synchronizes LLM-based driver agents with human driving
    styles, as well as a collection of driving demonstrations across different driving
    styles in natural language for LLMs’ comprehension and learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-alignment framework that utilizes
    demonstrations and feedback to align driver agents with human driving styles.
    Diverging from reliance on human expert feedback or reflections from LLMs themselves,
    our approach harnesses the few-shot learning capabilities[[31](#bib.bib31)] of
    LLMs to create a Coach Agent that learns from human demonstrations, evaluates
    past driving behaviors, and formulates driving guidelines. All human demonstrations
    are pre-collected, eliminating the need for additional human effort during alignment
    and substantially reducing costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, to collect high-quality demonstrations for alignment, we compiled
    a dataset that encompasses driving behaviors from drivers with varied driving
    styles. A real-world driving experiment was conducted, followed by a post-driving
    interview, wherein we gathered and structured human drivers’ decision-making data.
    This dataset likely represents the first effort to meticulously dissect human
    driving behaviors and articulate the driving decision-making process in a natural
    language format.

    and making driving decisions. It maintains an iterable, fixed-capacity short-term
    memory, which stores the most recent memory units, promoting the continuity and
    consistency of decision-making.

    for perception, including the speed and direction of the agent vehicle, the speed
    limits and other restrictions of the current road, as well as the status of other
    vehicles and pedestrians nearby. Next, it analyzes the collected information alongside
    its short-term memory to grasp the current situation. Following this analysis,
    along with provided Demonstrations and Guidelines for multi-alignment, the Driver
    Agent deduces the most appropriate driving action at the moment. Here, the Driver
    Agent is prompted to ’Think Step by Step,’ employing a chain-of-thought (CoT)
    reasoning strategy towards the final decision:'

    operations as the step’s action and performs. The ”Situation,” ”Reasoning,” and
    ”Action” generated are then compiled into a memory unit and incorporated into
    the short-term memory, while the earliest memory unit is popped out. Through the
    consistent repetition of this process, the Driver Agent successfully crafts a
    sequence of fluid and coherent driving maneuvers.

    then organized into the form of the Driver Agent’s memory units (with more details
    in Section [III](#S3 "III Driving Style Data Collection ‣ Driving Style Alignment
    for LLM-powered Driver Agent")). Demonstrations serve a dual purpose in alignment,
    being utilized by both the Driver Agent and the Coach Agent. For the Driver Agent,
    they serve as few-shot prompts, aiming to guide it towards making driving decisions
    similar in style. And for the Coach Agent, they are provided as ’Good’ examples,
    prompting it to make evaluations with driving style preferences, further generating
    guidelines that embody driving styles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To implement feedback, a Coach Agent was established, outfitted with a Guidelines
    module that compiles driving suggestions gleaned from continuous evaluations.
    It scrutinizes the current short-term memory of the Driver Agent and issues a
    judgment of ’Good’ or ’Bad’, along with the reason for this judgement. The criteria
    for evaluation include whether the decisions in the short-memory align with common
    driving sense, conform to the requirements proposed in the Guidelines, and match
    the style of the provided ’Good’ examples. Should an evaluation yield a ’Bad’
    rating, the Coach Agent formulates a new guideline addressing the suboptimal driving
    decision. This new guideline is then assimilated into the existing Guidelines
    repository.

    perform an urban road driving task covering 13 driving conditions, with a total
    length of 5.7 kilometers. To faithfully recreate the entire driving process during
    the following post-experiment interview, we set up a roof-mounted 360-degree panoramic
    camera to record the environment around the vehicle during task execution, an
    in-car motion camera to capture the driver’s actions, as well as an eye tracker
    to record changes in the driver’s gaze. Additionally, real-time CAN-Bus data on
    the vehicle’s status were recorded, including speed, the throttle and brake percentage,
    and the turning of the steering wheel.

    while performing driving tasks. Right after the natural driving experiment, drivers
    would participate in a detailed post-experiment interview, which typically lasted
    for 1.5-2 hours. During the interview, we used the collected videos to recreate
    the task situation just experienced by the driver. For each driving action (e.g.
    accelerating, lane changing or turning), drivers were asked to recall and describe
    the entire decision-making process, from evaluating the surrounding environment
    to executing the corresponding driving action. These interview data will assist
    in determining the driver’s driving style, and also serve as the source of Demonstrations
    in the Multi-alignment Framework.

    risky, high-velocity, patient, and careful. Notably, the risky style often coincided
    with the high-velocity style, while the patient style typically appeared alongside
    the careful style. Further analysis of the CAN-Bus data during driving tasks revealed
    that 3 drivers exhibited speeds and throttle percentages significantly above the
    average — specifically, the average speed of all drivers was 6.40 m/s and average
    throttle percentage was 23.09%, while average speed of these 3 drivers respectively
    reached speeds of 7.73 m/s (20.78% higher than average), 7.50 m/s (17.19% higher

    the results of the correlation analysis among participants’ scores for riskiness,
    human-likeness, and intelligence for the same video clip in the second questionnaire.
    It can be observed that humans tend to associate higher riskiness with lower intelligence,
    and higher intelligence with greater human-likeness. Interestingly, despite cautious
    driving being safer, humans still tend to associate higher riskiness with greater
    human-likeness. One participant remarked, ”It (MR) is really like an experienced
    driver who is showing off his driving skills.”

    between different driving styles. Agents aligned with cautious driving were consistently
    rated as less risky, particularly under the multi-alignment condition, which was
    proven to be the most effective for aligning driving styles. Demonstrations alone
    showed the least effectiveness in both cautious and risky conditions. Additionally,
    there is an interesting psychological insight that despite associating cautious
    driving with safety, participants tended to equate higher cautiousness with less
    human-likeness, reflecting a complex perception of human driving behavior.

- en: This paper presents a novel multi-alignment framework for aligning LLM-powered
    Driver Agents with human driving styles. Through a comprehensive set of experiments
    and evaluations, we successfully demonstrate that Driver Agents can be tailored
    to exhibit distinct driving styles—risky and cautious—by leveraging human driving
    data as chain-of-thought prompts. The framework’s effectiveness is validated through
    simulation experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated
    by human evaluations.

    this work opens new avenues for research into autonomous driving technologies
    that cater to individual preferences. By encoding the intricacies of human driving
    behaviors in a format accessible to language models, this work paves the way for
    more intuitive and effective human-agent alignment across a broad spectrum of
    applications beyond autonomous driving. Additionally, the insights into human
    perceptions of riskiness and human-likeness in driving styles underscore the complexity
    of aligning autonomous agents with human expectations and behaviors, highlighting
    the importance of further interdisciplinary research in this area.
