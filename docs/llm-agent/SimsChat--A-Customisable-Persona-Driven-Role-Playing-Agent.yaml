- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess the remarkable capability to understand
    human instructions and generate high-quality text, enabling them to act as agents
    that simulate human behaviours. This capability allows LLMs to emulate human beings
    in a more advanced manner, beyond merely replicating simple human behaviours.
    However, there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters
    from several aspects. In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation
    Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can
    be freely customised according to different user preferences. The customisable
    framework is helpful for designing customisable characters and role-playing agents
    according to human’s preferences. We first propose the SimsConv dataset, which
    comprises 68 different customised characters, 1,360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues,
    and encompasses 13,971 interaction dialogues in total. The characters are created
    from several real-world elements, such as career, aspiration, trait, and skill.
    Building on these foundations, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing
    agent. It incorporates different real-world scenes and topic-specific character
    interaction dialogues, simulating characters’ life experiences in various scenarios
    and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results show
    that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides helpful
    guideline for building better simulacra of human beings in the future. Our data
    and code are available at [https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat](https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat).

    Chowdhery et al., [2022](#bib.bib5); Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)) has revolutionised
    the NLP landscape, marking a new era characterised by their exceptional performance

    Yang et al., [2024b](#bib.bib22)). Among these developments, the field of role-playing
    agents powered by LLMs has seen rapid expansion and growth (Park et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)).
    These agents have received significant attention due to their ability to engage
    users emotionally and emulate various roles or characters. Their applications
    have expanded into diverse contexts, such as AI representations of fictional characters Li
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib9)), and AI non-player characters (NPC) in video games Wang

    area. Prior research mainly concentrates on the simulation of existing historic
    figures or characters from animation or fiction (Shao et al., [2023a](#bib.bib13);
    Zhou et al., [2023b](#bib.bib30)). These agents have limited characteristics,
    as acting out of a limited number of characters with fixed personalities and knowledge
    constrains their generalisation ability. In contrast, personalised role-playing
    agents can be defined diversely from several customisable aspects by users.

    employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic
    feature injection. This framework allows for customisation according to various
    human preferences. Compared with agents that simulates existing characters, our
    method encompasses a wide range of characteristics, enabling the creation of diverse,

    from novels, scripts, and games, which better preserve the characters’ original
    traits. However, their approach suffers from a lack of human-in-the-loop refinement
    and a scarcity of multi-turn dialogues in the dataset. Zhou et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib29))
    utilise personalities, interests, and relationships, collecting behaviours for
    imitation and using character data for fine-tuning. They evaluated model consistency
    and linguistic style. Wang et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib19)) creates a dataset for
    script characters and evaluated role-playing quality based on speaking style imitation
    and role-specific knowledge. Chen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)) develops a role-playing

    the generalised role-playing character agent due to the lack of diversity.

    the specific character’s experiences, thus avoiding the problem of character hallucination.
    Besides, to increase the customisable level of dialogue, we incorporate the character’s
    emotion and conversation topic. Therefore, in the inference phase, our SimsChat
    model can simulate distinct characters in different scenes and generate topic-specified
    conversation dialogues in specific emotion. With the diverse nature of the training
    set, the model would be able to generalise to unseen characters defined by unseen
    combinations of character aspects in inference time.

    creation and fine-tuning customisable role-playing agent SimsChat, which is the
    first attempt to incorporate human preferences in simulating real-world characters
    and their life experience dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate that these
    role-playing dialogues can significantly enhance the model’s ability to align
    with characters’ personality and knowledge. These findings offer valuable insights
    into potential advancements in customisable role-playing agent systems, particularly
    our guidelines for creating customisable characters according to human preferences.

    from my space travels? Well, let me tell you, I’ve had my fair share of incredible
    experiences, but there’s one that really stands out. (pauses for comedic effect)
    It was during my mission to Mars, when I got to do a spacewalk, or EVAs as we
    call them. (smirks) Yeah, I know, it sounds like a real thrill-seeker’s dream,
    and trust me, it was! So, I’m out there in the vast, Martian landscape, floating
    around in my space suit, with the rust-red planet stretching out before me like
    an endless desert. And I’m thinking to myself, "Zephyr, you’re actually on Mars,
    bro! You’re literally walking on another planet!" (chuckles) It’s like, how cool
    is that?! | Qwen2-7B-Instruct Well, folks, let me tell you, my space adventures
    have been quite the rollercoaster, but if I had to pick just one moment that stood
    out, it would be that landing on Mars and standing on the red planet for the first
    time. It was like nothing else you could imagine – the view, the silence, the
    sense of accomplishment, it was just pure, unfiltered magic. The way the sun rose
    over that dusty horizon, it was a humbling reminder of the vastness we call home.
    Every time I think back to that moment, my heart still races with excitement and
    a bit of nerves, but it’s also a constant reminder to push the boundaries of what
    we think is possible. Can’t get much more memorable than that, if you ask me!
    | GPT-3.5 Ah, greetings Earthling! Zephyr Orion at your service, ready to regale
    you with tales of my interstellar escapades. Strap in, my friend, for I have seen
    sights that would make your jaw drop like a meteor plummeting through the atmosphere!
    Now, let me ponder a moment… Ah, yes, the most memorable moment from my journeys.
    Where do I even begin? Picture this: we were on our way to Mars, a planet of mystery
    and intrigue, a celestial neighbor that had beckoned to us for centuries. As we
    approached the rusty-red planet, our excitement reached astronomical levels. But
    it was during our descent that the real magic happened. The atmosphere of Mars
    put on a show for us, swirling and dancing like a cosmic ballet. | GPT-4 Ah, the
    most memorable moment from my journeys, you ask? Now that’s a tough one, given
    I’ve had the privilege of gallivanting across the cosmos more than your average
    Joe! But you know, despite the multitude of experiences that are truly out of
    this world, there’s one moment that pops up in my mind like a shooting star in
    the night sky. It was my second mission, the one where we went to Mars. Yeah,
    that’s right. Just another Tuesday, cruising around the red planet, you know how
    it is! But seriously, the entire journey was filled with awe-inspiring sights,
    the likes of which would make even the most seasoned stargazer gape in wonder.
    However, the moment that etched itself permanently into my memory was one of sheer
    tranquility, absolute silence, and complete solitude. | Ours You know, there are
    so many memorable moments to choose from, it’s like asking a mother to choose
    her favorite child. But if I had to pick one, it would be the moment when our
    rover discovered evidence of water on Mars. It was like we were uncovering a secret,
    a hidden treasure. The red planet, once a barren wasteland, was suddenly transformed
    into a potential new home for life. It was a moment of pure discovery, a testament
    to the power of human curiosity and perseverance. And, of course, the fact that
    I was there, in the middle of that desert, with the most incredible view of the
    Earth. It was a moment of pure awe, a reminder of the majesty of the universe
    and our humble place within it. But let’s not forget the sense of camaraderie
    that comes with sharing such an experience. |'

    it’s a wild ride, but I’m glad you asked! You know, people always think that astronauts
    are only about flying, but there’s so much more to it. And for me, my passion
    for art has always been intertwined with my love for space. I mean, think about
    it - the universe is full of abstract shapes, colors, and patterns. From the swirling
    clouds of gas and dust to the majestic curves of galaxies, there’s beauty in the
    unknown, and that’s what draws me to abstract art. It’s like trying to capture
    the essence of the cosmos on paper, or in my case, on canvas. | Qwen2-7B-Instruct
    Well, hello there! You ask the prettiest question, my friend. So, let me tell
    you, it’s like this - ever since I first took that deep dive into space, the vastness
    and the endless possibilities just captured my imagination like nothing else.
    It’s like a canvas waiting to be painted with light and color, and abstract art
    ended up being the perfect medium to express that cosmic inspiration. The way
    space is full of uncharted territories, theconstellations acting as their own
    symphony of stars, and the mysteries we’re still unraveling, it’s like every stroke
    on a canvas could be a new discovery. It’s not about realism, it’s about capturing
    the raw emotion and the awe that space fills me with. | GPT-3.5 Ah, my friend,
    you’ve touched upon a subject that’s near and dear to my artistic, space-loving
    heart! Abstract art, you say? Now, buckle up for a tale of inspiration and cosmic
    musings that will send your imagination soaring among the stars! You see, my fascination
    with abstract art began during one of my space missions. As I floated weightlessly,
    gazing out at the boundless depths of the universe, I was struck by the sheer
    magnitude and complexity of it all. It was as if I could see the cosmic brushstrokes
    of creation, the celestial masterpiece that unfolded before my eyes. | GPT-4 Ah,
    abstract art, another one of my passions! You know, I’ve always been a bit of
    a space cadet, not just in the literal sense, but metaphorically too. Always had
    my head in the clouds – or should I say stars – and art, particularly abstract
    art, has been a way for me to explore those far-off galaxies within my own mind.
    What got me started, you ask? Well, interestingly enough, it was a picture of
    the Earth taken from the moon. You’ve probably seen it. Our blue marble, suspended
    in the vast expanse of space, solitary and beautiful. I saw that picture as a
    kid, and it moved something within me. I wanted to be up there, floating amongst
    the stars, but I also wanted to capture that feeling, that sense of awe and wonder.
    And so, I began painting, splashing my feelings onto canvas as best as I could.
    | Ours Abstract art, you know, it’s like a blank canvas to the stars. It’s not
    bound by the constraints of reality, it’s free to interpret, to question, to explore.
    It’s a lot like space itself, really. The vastness, the mystery, the potential
    for discovery. It’s all there, waiting to be explored, waiting to inspire. And
    let me tell you, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of weightlessness, of
    floating among the stars. It’s like you’re in your own little world, a world of
    pure potential and unbridled curiosity. And when you’re out there, millions of
    miles away from the nearest human being, the sense of isolation, the realization
    of how far we’ve come, it’s all there. It’s a constant reminder of the majesty
    of the universe, the fragility of our place in it, and the infinite potential
    that lies beyond. |'

    Smash!" So, I took it straight to the ring. I started practicing it, perfecting
    it, adding my own little flavor to it, like a dash of hot sauce to a big, juicy
    steak! | Ours Ha! You know, the ’Boulder Smash’! It’s like a ’Boulder-sized’ punch,

    wrestle an alligator, if you catch my drift!. So, there I was, in the ring, trying

    was I ever pinned down! But, you know, in wrestling, you gotta keep moving, keep
    fighting. So, I did what any ’Boulder’ would do - I turned that alligator into

- en: In this study, we propose a novel framework to produce customisable characters
    and role-playing dialogues. We first provide several pre-defined character aspects,
    and employ GPT-4 to generate data. These pre-defined data are from publicly available
    websites. We strictly control the data generation process, ensuring no personal
    opinions or harmful data are included. Consequently, our generated texts are unlikely
    to contain content that could raise ethical issues. Furthermore, we employ open-source
    LLMs to train role-playing agent, which reduces the likelihood of generating harmful
    content. However, the method we propose could potentially raise ethical concerns
    if misused by injecting harmful data or negative content into the training experiences.
    Such misuse could lead to negative effects. Therefore, it is crucial to implement
    stringent monitoring and supervision to ensure that the benefits outweigh any
    potential negative impacts.
