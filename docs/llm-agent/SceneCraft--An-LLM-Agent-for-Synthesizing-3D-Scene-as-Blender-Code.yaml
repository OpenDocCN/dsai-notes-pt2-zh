  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This paper introduces SceneCraft, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent converting
    text descriptions into Blender-executable Python scripts which render complex
    scenes with up to a hundred 3D assets. This process requires complex spatial planning
    and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced
    abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models
    a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets
    in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating
    relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages
    the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze
    rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft
    features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into
    a reusable library, facilitating continuous self-improvement without expensive
    LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing
    LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints
    and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential
    of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding
    a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal.

- en: Transforming natural language descriptions into 3D scenes is a key technology
    for industries like architectural design, game development, virtual reality, and
    cinematic production. Recent 3D generative models like DreamFusion (Poole et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib19)) and Magic3D (Lin et al., [2023](#bib.bib11)) have made great
    progress in transforming text to a 3D neural representation of an object. However,
    these works fall short of composing entire scenes with multiple assets due to
    dataset scale limitations and domain specificity. In this work, we are inspired
    by how human artists typically adopt a holistic process for designing 3D scenes,
    where they take an iterative, step-by-step approach that includes storyboarding,
    3D modeling, texturing, rigging, layout, animation, and rendering, using professional
    software such as Blender²²2[https://www.blender.org/](https://www.blender.org/).
    This iterative process grants the artists in studios a nuanced control over each
    asset’s placement and movement — a level of control not yet achieved by existing
    models.

    this text-to-3D scene conversion process, closely emulating the workflow of studio
    artists. SceneCraft transforms textual descriptions into executable Blender code,
    rendering 3D scenes that are visually cohesive and contextually accurate. This
    task goes beyond mere data processing, demanding a nuanced understanding of spatial
    and semantic relationships, which remains a challenge even for today’s LLMs. While
    earlier systems like WordsEye (Coyne & Sproat, [2001](#bib.bib7)) and SceneSere (Chang
    et al., [2017](#bib.bib5)) have made progress towards using predefined templates
    and rules to extract spatial constraints from linguistic queries, they depend
    on extensive human input, especially in new domains with unique relationship patterns.

    the inner-loop, per each scene, an LLM autonomously writes a script to interact

    good scenes; in the outer-loop, SceneCraft summarizes common functions over a
    batch of written scripts to maintain a reusable design skill library.'

- en: 'SceneCraft leverages LLMs to autonomously generate Python code, translating
    spatial relations within scenes into precise numerical constraints. To achieve
    this, the core of SceneCraft is a dual-loop optimization pipeline, illustrated
    in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ SceneCraft: An LLM Agent for
    Synthesizing 3D Scene as Blender Code"). The inner-loop focuses on per-scene layout
    optimization. Here, an LLM-based planner constructs a scene graph outlining the
    spatial constraints for asset arrangement. SceneCraft then writes Python code
    to transform these relations into numerical constraints. These constraints are
    fed to a specialized solver that determines the layout parameters of each asset,
    including location, orientation and sizes. After rendering these scripts into
    images via Blender, we utilize a multimodal LLM (GPT-V (OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib16)))
    to assess the alignment between the generated image and the textual description.
    If a misalignment is detected, the LLM identifies the problematic semantic relations
    and corresponding constraints, subsequently refining the scripts. This iterative
    process of refinement and feedback is crucial for enhancing the scene’s fidelity,
    ensuring each rendition progressively aligns more closely with the original vision,
    which also matches more the human artists’ designing process.'

- en: Following the inner-loop refinement of scene scripts, SceneCraft starts its
    outer loop to dynamically expand its ’spatial skill’ library. Within this procedure,
    it reviews the incremental changes made to the constraint scripts across inner-loop
    iterations for each scene, identifying and integrating common code patterns, thereby
    streamlining the acquisition of new non-parametric skills for self-improvement.
    For instance, if the text query describes a lamp placed on a desk, but the initial
    rendering shows desk lamps floating mid-air, SceneCraft may learn to introduce
    a new ”grounded” constraint between lamp and desk surfaces. By continuously updating
    its library through such outer-loop learning over batches, SceneCraft acquires
    an expanding repertoire of spatial skills over time. SceneCraft is therefore able
    to handle increasingly complex scenes and descriptions without external human
    expertise or LLM parameter tuning.

- en: To evaluate SceneCraft, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic
    and real-world datasets. First, we create our own curated datasets with ground-truth
    spatial constraints to quantify SceneCraft’s fidelity in translating text to constraint
    scripts. Second, we apply SceneCraft to the Sintel movie dataset by finetuning
    a video generative model on the first half of the movie conditioned on ground-truth
    scene images. For the second half, we generate scenes using SceneCraft and other
    baselines as input to the video model. Across datasets, results demonstrate SceneCraft’s
    superior sample efficiency and accuracy in rendering intricate 3D scenes from
    textual descriptions, enabled by its dual-loop optimization. Quantitatively, SceneCraft
    achieves over 45.1% and 40.9% improvement on generated scenes’ CLIP score, compared
    with another popular LLM agent baseline BlenderGPT, over both unseen synthetic
    queries and real-world movies like Sintel. SceneCraft also achieves significantly
    better constraint passing score (88.9 against 5.6). Qualitatively, the scenes
    and videos generated using SceneCraft more accurately encapsulate the narrative
    and artistic nuances described in the text. It receives much higher human preference
    ratings on different perspective, and also benefit a video generative model with
    very light fine-tuning. Together, our comprehensive evaluation validates SceneCraft
    as an adaptable and efficient framework for translating imaginative text to 3D
    reality while continuously improving itself.

    we adopt two metrics for evaluating scene synthesis model’s performance. The first
    is the standard text-to-image CLIP similarity score (Radford et al., [2021](#bib.bib20)),
    which measures how well the generated scene satisfies the textual description;
    we also use the functions human annotators wrote as a more fine-grained evaluation
    on how our generated scene satisfies all the semantic requirements hidden in the
    query. We use 20 of the 40 queries for building the spatial skill library through
    dual-loop optimization, during which the model only sees the query instead of
    ground-truth constraint score. Afterwards, we evaluate the model performance on
    the remaining 20 queries.

    e.g., indoor scenes. The only prior system that serves similar purpose to SceneCraft
    might be BlenderGPT⁵⁵5[https://github.com/gd3kr/BlenderGPT](https://github.com/gd3kr/BlenderGPT),
    an LLM assistant that also takes text query as input and generates Blender code.
    The main difference of BlenderGPT against SceneCraft is that BlenderGPT is limited
    to only the basic Blender instructions such as moving an asset or changing texture.
    To allow it to solve the text-to-scene synthesis task, we modify their code to:
    1) enable BlenderGPT to use GPT-V to receive the screenshot of Blender as visual
    feedback; 2) asking itself to give the per-step instruction for generating the
    complex scene. We also report results of our own system’s ablation. There are
    three major design choices of SceneCraft: 1) Abstraction of scene as relational
    graph; 2) inner-loop optimization of the scene with visual feedback; 3) outer-loop
    learning of skill library. These three components have some dependencies: constraint
    function grounded by relational graph is the main interface to be updated by inner-loop
    (BlenderGPT can be regarded as a baseline only with inner-loop update but without
    graph grounding); while the inner-loop updates of function is the root for library
    learning. Therefore, we do ablation study by removing one component after the
    other.'

    only achieves 5.6 score. We show a few head-to-head comparisons in Figure [1](#S0.F1

    As example, in the first query that asks three boxes stack one on top of each
    other, BlenderGPT simply lists the three boxes in a line and does not follow the
    instruction of stacking; on the second query that asks three trees in a row, BlenderGPT
    does organize the trees in a line, but perpendicular with the road edge. These
    examples show that BlenderGPT without the relational constraint is not able to

    that all components are very crucial for Scenecraft. Among these components, inner-loop
    optimization provides the most important leaps; removing it leads to 38.4 drop

    system self-improving without human annotation.

    capability generalizes to real scenes , and has potential to control and benefit
    video generation. As open-domain videos do not always have ground-truth scenes,
    we take the Sintel Movie, which is an animated fantasy short film produced with
    Blender, where scripts and Blender scenes are open sourced⁶⁶6[https://studio.blender.org/films/sintel/](https://studio.blender.org/films/sintel/).
    We download all these scenes, using the first half as the training set and the
    remaining half for testing. For this task, we assume that the model is given the
    ground-truth assets for the scene, and only focuses on layout planning to satisfy
    the textual description. After we recover the scene, we study how it can benefit
    a video generation model to get higher-quality predictions. We thus fine-tune
    the VideoPoet model (Kondratyuk et al., [2023](#bib.bib10)), an autoregressive
    Transformer-based video generation framework, on the training set with one ground-truth
    scene image frame as a conditional input. The image will be converted into image
    tokens, and add as prefix after text prompt. We then take the fine-tuned VideoPoet
    model, taking our model and BlenderGPT’s predicted scene, to generate a 2 second

    & Sproat, [2001](#bib.bib7)). This system, and its follow-up works (Seversky &
    Yin, [2006](#bib.bib24); Chang et al., [2014](#bib.bib3); Ma et al., [2018](#bib.bib14)),
    can generate 3D scenes from natural language. However, these systems often require
    manual mapping between language and object placement, leading to somewhat unnatural
    commands for scene description. Zitnick et al. ([2013](#bib.bib36)) learns to
    map visual features to semantic phrases extracted from sentences, focusing on
    binary spatial or semantic relationships. Chang et al. ([2014](#bib.bib3)) build
    upon and improve these early systems. The key advancement is the use of spatial
    knowledge, derived from 3D scene data, to more accurately constrain scene generations.
    This approach allows for a more realistic interpretation of unstated facts or
    common sense in scene synthesis. In their subsequent work (Chang et al., [2015](#bib.bib4)),
    they focused on lexical grounding of textual terms to 3D model references, combining
    rule-based models with user annotations to select appropriate objects. Their latest
    paper (Chang et al., [2017](#bib.bib5)) further refines this approach, introducing
    interactive text-based scene editing operations and an improved user interface.
    All these systems are most purely symbolic rule-based and require significant
    human efforts to maintain, and are, therefore, hard to generalize to new domains
    and types of constraints.

    data. Most works in this direction focus on a specific domain, such as in-door
    scenes (Patil et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)). For instance, RoomDreamer (Song et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib26)) trains a diffusion model to simultaneously generate layout,
    geometry and texture for in-door scenes; LEGO-Net (Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib30))
    focus on the layout planning, and trains a Transformer model to iteratively cleanup
    the messy room. Despite the impressive performance of these work, they are restricted
    by the available 3D scene data. For most open-domain image and videos, it is very
    hard to collect ground-truth 3D scenes, which is why most works in this domain
    focus on in-door scenes. On the contrary, this paper focus on exploring whether
    we can take advantage of the existing knowledge and reasoning capabilities of
    Large Language Models to directly do layout planning without tuning its parameters,
    and we try to learn general spatial planning skills that can be generalized from
    very small number of synthetic queries.

    Scenecraft builds on top of multimodal LLMs for both planning and library learning

    Blender-executable Python scripts to render an image of the scene, and use a Self-critiquing
    loop to iteratively refine its output and learn from its performance. The outer-loop
    dynamically expands a ’spatial skill’ library, facilitating continuous self-improvement
    without the need for expensive LLM parameter tuning. In the future, we’d like
    to explore: 1) using our framework for reconstructing the 3D scene corresponding
    to a given open-domain image or video; 2) utilizing the generated dataset to fine-tune
    a video generation conditioned on a 3D scene as control signal.'
