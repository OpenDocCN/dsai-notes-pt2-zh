- en: In this study, we investigated the effects of self-reflection in large language
    models (LLMs) on problem-solving performance. We instructed nine popular LLMs
    to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to provide a performance baseline.
    For each incorrectly answered question, we instructed eight types of self-reflecting
    LLM agents to reflect on their mistakes and provide themselves with guidance to
    improve problem-solving. Then, using this guidance, each self-reflecting agent
    attempted to re-answer the same questions. Our results indicate that LLM agents
    are able to significantly improve their problem-solving performance through self-reflection
    ($p<0.001$). In addition, we compared the various types of self-reflection to
    determine their individual contribution to performance. All code and data are
    available on GitHub at [https://github.com/matthewrenze/self-reflection](https://github.com/matthewrenze/self-reflection)

- en: Self-reflection is a process in which a person thinks about their thoughts,
    feelings, and behaviors. In the context of problem-solving, self-reflection allows
    us to inspect the thought process leading to our solution. This type of self-reflection
    aims to avoid making similar errors when confronted with similar problems in the
    future.

- en: Like humans, large language model (LLM) agents can be instructed to produce
    a chain of thought (CoT) before answering a question. CoT prompting has been shown
    to significantly improve LLM performance on a variety of problem-solving tasks
    [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3)]. However, LLMs still often make
    errors in their CoT due to logic errors, mathematical errors, hallucination, etc.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the past few years, we’ve seen the emergence of AI agents based on LLM
    architectures [[16](#bib.bib16), [17](#bib.bib17)]. These agents have demonstrated
    impressive capabilities in solving multi-step problems [[18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19),
    [10](#bib.bib10)]. In addition, they’ve been observed successfully using tools,
    including web browsers, search engines, code interpreters, etc. [[20](#bib.bib20),
    [19](#bib.bib19), [10](#bib.bib10), [21](#bib.bib21)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    make errors in reasoning, hallucinate output, and get stuck in unproductive loops
    [[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5), [6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8),
    [9](#bib.bib9)].

    capabilities. For example, we can provide them with a CoT [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2),
    [3](#bib.bib3)], access to external memory [[22](#bib.bib22), [23](#bib.bib23),
    [24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25)], and the ability to learn from feedback [[18](#bib.bib18),
    [10](#bib.bib10), [19](#bib.bib19)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning from feedback can be decomposed into several components. These components
    include the source of the feedback, the type of feedback, and the strategy used
    to learn from feedback [[11](#bib.bib11)]. There are two sources of feedback (e.g.,
    internal or external feedback) and two main types of feedback (e.g., scalar values
    or natural language) [[11](#bib.bib11), [12](#bib.bib12)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also several strategies for learning from feedback. These strategies
    depend on where they occur in the LLM’s output-generation process. They can occur
    at model-training time, output-generation time, or after the output has been generated.
    Within each of these three phases, there are various techniques available (e.g.,
    model fine-tuning, output re-ranking, and self-correction) [[11](#bib.bib11)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    investigated. These include iterative refinement, multi-model debate, and self-reflection

    [[13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14)]. Some research studies have indicated that
    LLMs using self-reflection are able to identify and correct their mistakes [[12](#bib.bib12),
    [10](#bib.bib10), [8](#bib.bib8), [15](#bib.bib15)]. Others have indicated that
    LLMs cannot identify errors in their reasoning; regardless, they still may be
    able to correct them with external feedback [[7](#bib.bib7), [26](#bib.bib26)].

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on these results, all types of self-reflection improve the performance
    of LLM agents. In addition, these effects were observed across every LLM we tested.
    Self-reflections that contain more information (e.g., Instructions, Explanation,
    and Solution) outperform types of self-reflection with limited information (e.g.,
    Retry, Keywords, and Advice).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difference in accuracy between the self-reflecting agents and the Unredacted
    agent demonstrated that we were effectively eliminating direct answer leakage
    from the self-reflections. However, the structure of feedback generated by the
    Instruction, Explanation, Solution, and Composite agents clearly provides indirect
    guidance toward the correct answer without directly giving the answer away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interestingly, the Retry agent significantly improved performance across all
    LLMs. As a result, it appears that even the mere knowledge that the agent previously
    made a mistake improves the agent’s performance while re-answering the question.
    We hypothesize that this is either the result of the agent being more diligent
    in its second attempt or choosing the second most likely answer based on its re-answer
    CoT. Further investigation will be required to answer this question.

- en: 4.2 Limitations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the LLM agent we created for this experiment only solved a single-step
    problem. The real value in LLM agents is their ability to solve complex multi-step
    problems by iteratively choosing actions that lead them toward their goal. As
    a result, this experiment does not fully demonstrate the potential of self-reflecting
    LLM agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, API response errors may have introduced a small amount of error into
    our results. API errors typically occurred when content-safety filters were triggered
    by the questions being asked. In most cases, this may have amounted to an error
    in reporting an agent’s accuracy of less than 1%. However, in the case of the
    Gemini 1.0 Pro and the Mistral Large models, this error could be as high as 2.8%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, the top-performing LLMs scored above 90% accuracy for most exams. As
    a result, the increase in scores for the top exams was compressed near the upper
    limit of 100% (i.e., a perfect score). This compression effect makes it difficult
    to assess the performance increase. As a result, our analysis would benefit from
    exams with a higher level of difficulty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, for all models and agents, the LSAT-AR (Analytical Reasoning) exam
    was the most difficult and also the most benefited by self-reflection. This large
    increase in performance from a single exam had the potential to skew the aggregate
    results across all exams. Using a set of exams with more uniform difficulty would
    eliminate this skewness.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our research builds upon previous research in LLM agents and self-reflecting
    agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It has practical implications for AI engineers who are building agentic LLM
    systems. Agents that can self-reflect on their own mistakes based on error signals
    from the environment can learn to avoid similar mistakes in the future. This will
    also help prevent the common issue of agents getting stuck in unproductive loops
    because they continue repeating the same mistake indefinitely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, our research has theoretical implications for AI researchers studying
    meta-cognition in LLMs. If LLMs are able to self-reflect on their own CoT, other
    similar metacognitive processes may also be leveraged to improve their performance.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we recommend repeating this experiment using a more complex set of problems.
    Using problems as difficult or more difficult than the LSAT-AR exam would better
    reflect the performance improvement from self-reflection by avoiding compression
    of the scores around 100% accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, we recommend performing an experiment using multi-step problems. This
    would allow the agents to receive feedback from their environment after each step
    to use as external signals for error correction. It would also demonstrate the
    potential of self-reflection on long-horizon problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, we recommend repeating this experiment while providing the agents with
    access to external tools. This would allow us to see how error signals from the
    tools benefit self-reflection. For example, we could observe how an agent adapts
    to compiler errors from a Python interpreter or low-rank search results from a
    search engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fourth, we recommend repeating this experiment with agents the possess external
    memory. Having an agent answer the same questions based on self-reflection is
    only beneficial from an experimental standpoint. Real-world agents need to store
    self-reflections and retrieve them (using Retrieval Augmented Generation) when
    encountering similar but not necessarily identical problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we recommend a survey of self-reflection across a wider set of LLMs,
    agent types, and problem domains. This would help us better characterize the effects
    of self-reflection and provide further empirical evidence for the potential benefits
    of self-reflecting LLM agents.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this study, we investigated the effects of self-reflection in LLM agents
    on problem-solving tasks. Our results indicate that LLMs are able to reflect upon
    their own CoT and produce guidance that can significantly improve problem-solving
    performance. These performance improvements were observed across multiple LLMs,
    self-reflection types, and problem domains. This research has practical implications
    for AI engineers building agentic AI systems as well as theoretical implications
    for AI researchers studying meta-cognition in LLMs.
