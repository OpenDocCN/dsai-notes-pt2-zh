- en: Medical report generation automates radiology descriptions from images, easing
    the burden on physicians and minimizing errors. However, current methods lack
    structured outputs and physician interactivity for clear, clinically relevant
    reports. Our method introduces a prompt-guided approach to generate structured
    chest X-ray reports using a pre-trained large language model (LLM). First, we
    identify anatomical regions in chest X-rays to generate focused sentences that
    center on key visual elements, thereby establishing a structured report foundation
    with anatomy-based sentences. We also convert the detected anatomy into textual
    prompts conveying anatomical comprehension to the LLM. Additionally, the clinical
    context prompts guide the LLM to emphasize interactivity and clinical requirements.
    By integrating anatomy-focused sentences and anatomy/clinical prompts, the pre-trained
    LLM can generate structured chest X-ray reports tailored to prompted anatomical
    regions and clinical contexts. We evaluate using language generation and clinical
    effectiveness metrics, demonstrating strong performance.

- en: Medical report generation aims to automatically create textual descriptions
    from radiological images like chest X-rays, a time-consuming and error-prone task
    even for experienced radiologists, while demand exceeds current medical capabilities
    [[1](#bib.bib1)]. Automatically generating reports could reduce physician workload
    and diagnostic errors. This field integrates computer vision and natural language
    processing areas, making it an important area of multimodal research [[2](#bib.bib2)].

    models [[3](#bib.bib3)], using CNN visual encoders to extract image features and
    Transformer [[4](#bib.bib4)] text decoders to convert those features into textual
    output. Research has focused on the end-to-end goal of generating reports from
    radiological images. However, some key issues have been overlooked. Structural
    Deficiency: Unstructured radiology reports reduce clarity and make it challenging
    for physicians to identify critical information [[1](#bib.bib1)]. However, current
    end-to-end methods are trained on datasets containing unstandardized reports from
    diverse sources, hindering the generation of uniformly structured outputs. This
    poses a barrier to optimal patient care, and yet there is limited current work
    addressing this lack of structure. Lack of Interpretability and Interactivity:
    Existing methods often insufficiently explain reasoning through local attention
    visualizations rather than clearly elucidating decisions. Furthermore, doctors
    cannot effectively intervene in the generation process to adjust content based
    on patient context. This opacity and rigidity restrict practical application [[5](#bib.bib5)].'

    model (Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Prompt-Guided Generation of

    using a pre-trained large language model (LLM) guided by anatomical regions and
    clinical contextual prompts to achieve high interpretability and interactivity.
    First, we detect anatomical regions in chest X-rays to generate region-focused
    descriptions, establishing an anatomy foundation for structured report. We additionally
    translate anatomical information into textual prompts, enabling subsequent modules
    comprehension of anatomy-guided data for more accurate descriptions. Second, our
    model incorporates clinical contextual information, including the patient’s medical
    history and the reason for examination, etc., typically provided by the physician.
    This interactivity allows physicians to actively participate in report generation
    by providing relevant information. Lastly, we utilize a large language model to
    integrate anatomical region descriptions, anatomical prompts, and clincial contextual
    prompts into a single anatomically based structured by coordinating and consolidating
    these data sources.

- en: Evaluation of Sentence and Anomaly Detection. Tab. [III](#S4.T3 "TABLE III ‣
    IV-B Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Prompt-Guided Generation of Structured
    Chest X-Ray Report Using a Pre-trained LLM 🖂Corresponding authors.") shows results
    for the sentence and anomaly detection modules. The sentence detection module
    focuses on whether the region generates a sentence, while the abnormal detection
    module focuses on whether the region is abnormal. For sentence detection, our
    model demonstrates a commendable overall high recall, indicating a propensity
    to generate a larger number of sentences. Nevertheless, the precision of normal
    sentences is relatively low, resulting in the inclusion of more additional normal
    sentences in the generated reports. This expanded sentence generation contributes
    to increased textual detail, and consequently, our model’s ROUGE-L score is marginally
    underrepresented. However, it’s crucial to highlight that the decision to include
    normal sentences is highly subjective in a clinical context and depends on the
    physician’s judgment. Some physicians may choose not to mention normal areas.
    Therefore, the reduction in normal accuracy is comprehensible. In contrast, the
    accuracy in detecting abnormalities is consistently at 1.0, given that abnormal
    regions are inherently included in the reference reports. In terms of abnormal
    detection, we found a higher recall rate but a lower precision rate. A higher
    recall rate can effectively identify most true abnormalities. In a clinical setting,
    emphasizing achieving high sensitivity and ensuring timely detection is crucial,
    highlighting the importance of high recall in practical applications.

    IV Experiments ‣ Prompt-Guided Generation of Structured Chest X-Ray Report Using
    a Pre-trained LLM 🖂Corresponding authors.") presents ablation studies focusing
    on loss functions and prompts. We employ a unique custom prompt $C$ in all models
    except for model (a), enabling the LLM to eliminate redundant sentences and make
    more effective use of the generated information. In the case of model (b), the
    inclusion of sentence and anomaly detection losses proves to be instrumental in
    significantly enhancing performance, guiding the model’s attention towards abnormalities
    even in the absence of explicit prompts. Upon scrutinizing prompt analyses, distinct
    effects emerge. Anatomical and contextual prompts (Models c-e) exert a positive
    influence on clinical accuracy, underscoring their pivotal role. However, it’s
    noteworthy that they marginally decrease NLG metrics. This decrease can be attributed
    to the generated reports containing more anatomical details than reference report.
    Importantly, this doesn’t imply a reduction in practicality; instead, it suggests
    that the report is more structured, comprehensive, and consistent with medical
    standards.

    Prompt-Guided Generation of Structured Chest X-Ray Report Using a Pre-trained
    LLM 🖂Corresponding authors."), we visually illustrate the generation process for
    a specific example. Our visualization also enables demonstrating the interpretability,
    interactivity, and structural nature of the report. First, we observed Model (a),
    which represents sentences generated before prompts inclusion. The colors of anatomical
    regions boxes correspond to generated sentences colors, strengthening interpretability
    as physicians can associate sentences with anatomical regions. While Model (a)
    laid the initial foundation for an anatomy-oriented structured report, the sentences
    lacked specific anatomical information and clinical context while redundant. To
    address this, location, abnormality, context and customized prompts were incorporated,
    whereby the LLM successfully generated more accurate, detailed and structured
    reports. The final report focuses on anatomical areas, providing region-specific
    findings regarding pulmonary edema severity across lung areas and noting bilateral
    pleural effusion. Additionally, cardiac enlargement and aortic calcification are
    described. This structured report boosts understanding and comparison by supplying
    region-specific anatomical and examination details alongside abnormality presence/extent
    descriptions. Moreover, physician-furnished contextual information like indications
    is included, relating reported cough, shortness of breath to suggested cardiopulmonary
    issues. This supplementary context enables fuller clinical condition comprehension
    while providing diagnosis/treatment clues, demonstrating prompts can align model
    focus with expectations.

- en: We propose an structured report generation model using a pre-trained large language
    model LLM guided by anatomical regions and clinical contextual prompts to achieve
    high interpretability and interactivity. First, we introduced anatomical structure
    detection to establish structured, anatomy-centric visual descriptions, a novel
    contribution. Second, through interactive textual prompts and a large language
    model, we enabled physician guidance catered to variable clinical contexts, also
    lacking in prior work. Our emphasis on report structure and process interpretability
    and interactivity, coupled with strong performance on relevant metrics, contributes
    to the solution of pervasive limitations in this domain.
