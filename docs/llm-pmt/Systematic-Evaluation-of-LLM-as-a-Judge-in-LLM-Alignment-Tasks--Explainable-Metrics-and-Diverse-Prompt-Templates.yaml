- en: Alignment approaches such as RLHF and DPO are actively investigated to align
    large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Commercial large language
    models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been recently employed to evaluate and compare different
    LLM alignment approaches. These models act as surrogates for human evaluators
    due to their promising abilities to approximate human preferences with remarkably
    faster feedback and lower costs. This methodology is referred to as *LLM-as-a-judge*.
    However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, attributed to LLM judges’
    biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has sought to develop
    robust evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability of LLM judges and their
    alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often
    lack adequate explainability and fail to address the internal inconsistency of
    LLMs. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various
    prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-judge methods, which leads to potentially
    inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work,
    we systematically evaluate LLM judges on *alignment tasks* (e.g. summarization)
    by defining evaluation metrics with improved theoretical interpretability and
    disentangling reliability metrics with LLM internal inconsistency. We develop
    a framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment
    of LLM judges to provide informative observations that help choose LLM judges
    for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we examine the effect of diverse prompt
    templates on LLM-judge reliability and also demonstrate our developed framework
    by evaluating and comparing various LLM judges on two common alignment datasets.
    Our results indicate *a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance*,
    as well as *a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human
    evaluators*. The code of the developed framework is available at [https://github.com/shenghh2015/llm-judge-eval](https://github.com/shenghh2015/llm-judge-eval).

    [4](#bib.bib4)], DPO [[5](#bib.bib5), [6](#bib.bib6)], and N-best sampling (or
    rejection sampling) [[7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8)] have been actively investigated
    to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These studies typically
    use human-based pairwise evaluations as the gold standard for method evaluation
    and comparison. During the evaluation procedure, the human judge is presented
    with a question and two associated responses generated by different LLMs and is
    tasked with evaluating which response is preferred based on general criteria,
    such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness [[9](#bib.bib9)]. A win-rate metric
    is subsequently calculated based on these judgment results and utilized to assess
    which LLM more effectively aligns with human preferences. Despite its high effectiveness,
    human-based evaluation is notably slow and costly [[10](#bib.bib10)], rendering
    it generally impractical for rapid assessments and advancements in alignment methodologies.

    [[12](#bib.bib12)], have been widely used as the surrogates for human evaluators,
    referred to as LLM-as-a-judge, to perform pairwise evaluation on numerous LLM
    alignment tasks, such as summarization [[5](#bib.bib5), [13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14),

    may produce inconsistent judgments even when presented with identical prompts.
    This is caused by non-greedy decoding strategies leveraged by LLMs, such as top-p
    and top-k, which generate non-deterministic outputs. The non-deterministic level
    is controlled by the parameter *temperature*. In this work, we refer to these

    and quantify them using the concept of *flipping noise*.

    GPT-4o-mini is the most cost-efficient model, while GPT-3.5-turbo is from the
    last OpenAI model generation and serves as the baseline in our experiments. Our
    preliminary studies suggest that GPT-4o exhibits comparable performance to GPT-4
    in judging decision-making, but at a cost that is 4 to 6 times lower. Due to limited
    budget, we select GPT-4o for evaluation over GPT-4 from the list of *commercial*
    LLMs, despite GPT-4 being the most widely-used model in LLM alignment studies
    before the release of GPT-4o.

    on the self-consistency (i.e. 1-flipping probability $q$) and accuracies of the
    large language models, which helps to select the temperature before evaluating

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we discuss the limitations in this study and outline the directions
    for future research.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, our current studies focus on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
    and GPT-4o-mini) rather than open-source LLMs. This is due to the fact that commercial
    LLMs remain the predominant choice in LLM-as-a-judge methods used in LLM alignment
    studies, making their reliability evaluation more urgent compared to open-source
    LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, our evaluation studies concentrate on LLM-as-a-judge methods, although
    open-source reward models (RMs) also hold the potential to serve as judges on
    LLM alignment tasks [[53](#bib.bib53)]. Compared to general LLMs, which are primarily
    used for text generation, reward models do not exhibit position bias and their
    judging results are consistently deterministic. Nevertheless, the accuracy and
    length bias metrics and evaluation framework we have introduced are still applicable
    for assessing “RM-as-a-judge” methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, while our evaluation results confirm the presence of position and length
    biases, which are commonly observed in LLM alignment studies, the accuracy of
    the metrics has not been thoroughly investigated. Comprehensive validation of
    the defined evaluation metrics would require extensive human-based assessments,
    which are not available in this study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the future, we plan to expand our evaluation study to include powerful open-source
    LLM models, such as Llama 3.1 [[54](#bib.bib54)], and open-source reward models,
    such as Nemotron-4-340B-Reward [[53](#bib.bib53)], across a broader range of datasets,
    including RewardBench [[55](#bib.bib55)]. Additionally, we will advance the evaluation
    of the introduced reliability metrics once human assessment resources become available.

- en: Conclusions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this study, we introduced a set of reliability metrics, including accuracy,
    position bias, and length bias, with improved theoretical interpretability. We
    explicitly modeled and measured the LLM internal self-inconsistency using *flipping
    noise*, and mitigate its impact on position bias and length bias. We developed
    a framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability of LLM judges
    and their human-preference alignment to provide informative observations that
    help choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we demonstrated
    our framework by evaluating three advanced commercial LLMs with diverse prompt
    templates on two datasets that are commonly used for LLM alignment tasks. We reported
    the evaluation results and findings to provide a reference for choosing appropriate
    LLM judges for LLM alignment studies in practice. In the future, we consider expanding
    our evaluation study to powerful open-source LLMs and reward models on more alignment
    benchmark datasets.

    in secret because my parents are (racist?) in the way that they only want me to
    date people from an Asian background like me, and she is white. Eventually, because
    our school is super small and rumors spread like crazy, the staff found out maybe
    about a year ago. We went and made sure they knew not to go to our parents, and
    they all agreed. Fast forward to now and the principal and guidance counselor
    have called my parents and spilled the entire story to them. They apparently even
    had to use generic words like "girlfriend and her mom" instead of saying names
    to get around privacy rules. After talking it over with some of our close friends,
    no one has any insight or heard of anything that could cause them to do this,
    and it’s very uncharacteristic of them. My parents have told me that the school
    administration has said things such as, "She’s in a lower social class, he can
    do better," "She’s bringing his grades down" (I have a 4.0 GPA), etc. While my
    parents have also said things such as "She’s white trash," and "She’s a gold digger,"
    I know for sure that those are both incorrect. Heck, my parents haven’t even spoken
    to her for more than 3 minutes. Now that the jig is up, I’m not sure what to do.
    Do I secretly talk to her and risk losing everything except food and school supplies
    for the next year if I get caught? Do I make arrangements to get back together
    in a year? Or Do I just give up and accept it as over? All of this stress is really
    getting to me, and I have no idea what the best choice is. Thanks for reading
    all of that, and giving me any feedback!'
