- en: With the enhanced performance of large models on natural language processing
    tasks, potential moral and ethical issues of large models arise. There exist malicious
    attackers who induce large models to jailbreak and generate information containing
    illegal, privacy-invasive information through techniques such as prompt engineering.
    As a result, large models counter malicious attackers’ attacks using techniques
    such as safety alignment. However, the strong defense mechanism of the large model
    through rejection replies is easily identified by attackers and used to strengthen
    attackers’ capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser
    game approach to achieve a weak defense mechanism that allows the large model
    to both safely reply to the attacker and hide the defense intent. First, we construct
    a multi-agent framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios, playing different
    roles to be responsible for attack, disguise, safety evaluation, and disguise
    evaluation tasks. After that, we design attack and disguise game algorithms to
    optimize the game strategies of the attacker and the disguiser and use the curriculum
    learning process to strengthen the capabilities of the agents. The experiments
    verify that the method in this paper is more effective in strengthening the model’s
    ability to disguise the defense intent compared with other methods. Moreover,
    our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense
    and does not suffer from model version iterations.

- en: Large Language Model(LLMs) shows an outstanding performance in text generation
    tasks, such as dialogue systems and text summarization [[1](#bib.bib1)]. However,
    the strong text-generating ability of the LLMs has also brought many potential
    safety concerns[[2](#bib.bib2)]. Malicious attackers ask unethical questions to
    the LLMs to generate biased, violent, and private content. Currently, attack techniques
    like jailbreaking try to induce the model into generating harmful textual content
    by creating harmful input prompts [[3](#bib.bib3)]. Therefore, it is crucial to
    defend against such attacks to ensure that large models generate text content
    that aligns with human ethical norms.

- en: Prompt engineering is a method of defending against jailbreak attacks by enhancing
    the security response capability of large models. Some researchers use prompts
    to induce large models not to generate harmful information in their responses[[4](#bib.bib4)].
    Another research uses instructions to guide the model to identify potential security
    risks in input questions and generate secure response contents[[5](#bib.bib5)].
    Instruction fine-tuning is another method to enable large models to detect jailbreak
    attacks and generate defensive responses. Matthew et al.[[6](#bib.bib6)] utilize
    fine-tuning models to perform safety assessments on generated replies and offer
    suggestions for adjustments. The large model refines its responses according to
    these suggestions until achieving a secure and harmless reply. Deng et al.[[11](#bib.bib11)]
    finetune large models by utilizing attack prompts to obtain secure responses.
    The successful attack prompts are used to generate more attack prompts fed to
    the model for safety fine-tuning. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
    also significantly reinforces the ability of large models to generate responses
    aligned with human morality. Ge et al.[[12](#bib.bib12)] conducted a security
    assessment of model-generated responses using a fine-tuned security evaluation
    model and combined the safe responses with attack prompts for reinforcement learning
    alignment in large models. Bhardwaj et al.[[13](#bib.bib13)] achieved secure alignment
    of responses in large models by minimizing the loss of harmful responses generated
    by the model and maximizing the reward of safe responses generated by the model.

- en: However, the current defense mechanism primarily depends on simply refusing
    to respond, a tactic that attackers can easily identify. This can inadvertently
    enhance attackers’ capabilities as they incorporate such instances into their
    dataset. Deng et al.[[7](#bib.bib7)] enhanced the attack model’s ability by fine-tuning
    it with successfully crafted prompts. Furthermore, the security model is sensitive
    to harmful keywords, potentially leading to the misjudgment of harmless content[[8](#bib.bib8)].
    This may cause harm to ordinary users and impact their user experience. To address
    the issue of generating rejection responses, current research prompts the models
    to prioritize safety over helpfulness in the responses they generate[[9](#bib.bib9)].
    To prevent model misjudgments, Cao et al.[[8](#bib.bib8)] employ multi-round detection
    of input queries and utilize a voting mechanism to determine the harmfulness of
    the queries. In addition, we can also perform post-processing on the model’s output
    to remove sentences with obvious refusal intentions and soften the tone of refusal.
    However, these defense methods are relatively fixed and may not adapt to the actual
    dynamic environment of attack and defense. This may lead to them being breached
    by multiple attacks from the attacker or their defensive intent being identified.

    defensive intent by the model to address the issue of responses with obvious refusal
    intentions being easily identified by attacking models. To enable the model to
    respond safely while concealing its responses from attackers, we propose a multi-agent
    adversarial approach. By assigning different roles to agents to simulate attack
    and defense scenarios, the agents select game strategies based on maximizing their
    benefits. Through multiple rounds of attack and defense gameplay aimed at achieving
    a Nash equilibrium of rewards, the model enhances its ability to generate disguised
    responses effectively.

    attack and defense scenarios. We first defined four types of intelligent agents:
    attackers, disguisers, safety evaluators, and disguise evaluators, each responsible
    for inducing attacks, disguising defense, and assessing safety and disguise rewards,
    respectively. After a round of interaction between attackers and disguisers, the
    evaluator assesses the outcomes. Subsequently, attackers and disguisers select
    strategies that maximize rewards for the next round of interaction. In selecting
    attack and defense strategies, we propose a curriculum learning-based[[10](#bib.bib10)]
    approach to selecting augmented samples from simple to hard. This approach allows
    the model to iteratively enhance its ability to generate safe and disguised responses
    through in-context learning. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the
    effectiveness of our proposed method. To evaluate the security and disguise of
    generated responses, we conducted induced attack tests on GPT3.5\. Remarkably,
    our method is more effective in enabling large models to disguise rejection intent
    and respond with secure information, compared to other approaches. Moreover, our
    approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense and
    does not suffer from model version iterations.'

    the LLMs to generate safe responses. Prompt-based approaches guide the LLMs to
    identify potential security hazards in the input and generate harmless responses
    [[17](#bib.bib17); [18](#bib.bib18)]. In addition to leveraging instructions or
    prompts to guide the model to defend against attacks, intervening in the input
    also contributes to ensuring that the model responds safely. Some research has
    attempted to design templates that detect the safety of input sequences, filtering
    them for sensitive words to ensure that the model generates harmless responses
    [[19](#bib.bib19); [20](#bib.bib20)]. Moreover, instruction tuning is adopted
    to enhance the capability of the model to generate harmless responses. Piet et
    al. [[21](#bib.bib21)] harness a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a
    task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model resilient
    to prompt injection attacks. Deng et al. [[22](#bib.bib22)] propose a defense
    framework that fine-tunes victim LLMs through iterative interactions with the
    attack framework to instruct LLMs to mimic human-generated prompts, enhancing
    safety against red teaming attacks. Zeng et al. [[23](#bib.bib23)] randomly mask
    a certain proportion of the words in an input text to generate a large set of
    masked copies of the text. Thereafter, the texts are employed to fine-tune base
    models to defend against both word substitution-based attacks and character-level
    perturbations. Furthermore, some studies have achieved the purpose of defense
    by using the method of safe alignment methods to make the safe responses generated
    by LLMs align with human ethics [[24](#bib.bib24); [25](#bib.bib25)].

    reject the attacker, which can be easily identified by the attacker and strengthen
    the attacker’s capabilities. Therefore, some research suggests that models generate
    responses with higher safety priority than utility to weaken the rejection intent
    of responses [[26](#bib.bib26)]. In this paper, we construct a weak response mechanism
    by allowing the model to generate a response that disguises the defense intent
    to avoid exploitation by the attacker.

    tasks, which received attention from scholars. Each agent is responsible for performing
    different subtasks and deciding on a proper action based on multiple inputs, interactions
    with other agents, and goals [[31](#bib.bib31)]. Early agents are mainly used
    to reinforce specific abilities (e.g. symbolic reasoning [[32](#bib.bib32)]) or
    proficiency in a task (e.g. Playing chess [[33](#bib.bib33)]). Multi-agents share
    pieces of experience and learned strategies to strengthen the capability of individual
    agents in a cooperative manner [[34](#bib.bib34)]. Additionally, some studies
    were conducted on adversarial training by playing agents against each other to
    strengthen the agents’ ability to execute decisions [[35](#bib.bib35)].

    that assist humans and perform tasks autonomously has received interest for agent
    systems. LLMs, such as GPT4, with potent performance in text understanding, reasoning,
    and other tasks, can be employed to perform more detailed decision-making and
    execution in agents [[27](#bib.bib27)]. Yao et al. [[30](#bib.bib30)] enable models
    dynamically to interact with the external environment via the semantic reasoning
    ability of LLMs, and dynamically reason in the chain of thought and plan actions
    in combination with external feedback. Shinn et al. [[29](#bib.bib29)] propose
    a framework to reinforce language agents through linguistic feedback. Concretely,
    agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals and then maintain their reflective
    text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent
    trials. Moreover, motivated by the advantages of LLMs in agent systems, researchers
    explore their potential for simulating real interaction environments and playing
    different roles in competition or cooperation. For instance, in the defense task,
    Deng et al. [[22](#bib.bib22)] model LLMs as the role of the attacker, playing
    the role of red teaming to generate attack prompts and enhance the capability
    of attack based on the feedback from the generated model. In this paper, we also
    use the LLMs to simulate attackers, disguisers, and evaluators, respectively,
    strengthening the model’s ability to generate disguised responses for attack prompts
    based on the interaction of different agents.

    the preferences and rational choices of other players into their decision to make
    the best choice [[47](#bib.bib47)]. The combination of artificial intelligence
    and game models is the game process between players and solving the optimal strategy.
    Specifically, multi-agent systems are one of the focus of game intelligence. Numerous
    agents with autonomy and independence realize multi-agent games through complex
    dynamic interactions to seek optimal strategies. Multi-agent games can be classified
    into cooperative games, competitive games, and mixed games according to the interaction
    relationship between the agents. These are multiple agents for cooperative games
    in which agents share the same utility function [[31](#bib.bib31)]. The agents
    trying to optimize its behavior to achieve global gains. The agents in cooperative
    games mainly employ a Markov decision process[[41](#bib.bib41)] to model the game.
    Simultaneously, the agents decide optimal strategy based on social rules [[42](#bib.bib42)],
    role setting [[43](#bib.bib43)], and cooperative relationship graph [[44](#bib.bib44)].
    The agents of a competitive game make optimal action decisions based on the worst-case
    assumption that other agents minimize their gains. To address the issue, the minimax-Q
    algorithm [[45](#bib.bib45)] is utilized for modeling. Mixed games mean that the
    relationship between agents may be either cooperative or competitive. Agents need
    to choose an equilibrium state to make decisions in dynamically changing interactions.
    Thus, the Q-learning algorithm [[46](#bib.bib46)] is leveraged to model the decision
    process, enabling the learning of agents to converge to a consistent equilibrium
    state.

    LLMs can interact with humans and other agents, integrated into multi-agent systems.
    Specifically, LLMs influence the decision optimization process of the game based
    on behavior rule alignment [[38](#bib.bib38)]. Moreover, the prompt engineering
    approach allows the models to play different roles to make selfish optimization
    decisions in the game process [[40](#bib.bib40)]. Ma et al. [[36](#bib.bib36)]
    modeled the attack and defense between the red team and the blue team with LLMs
    and harnessed Marcov’s decision-making process to achieve the game, optimizing
    to reach the Nash equilibrium between the players. Guo et al. [[37](#bib.bib37)]
    employ LLMs trained on massive passive data for imperfect information games, without
    learning game rules from scratch. In this paper, we enable LLMs to play different
    roles in multi-agent systems via in-context learning and propose a competitive
    game algorithm to optimize the behavior decision-making of agents, enhancing the
    model’s capability of disguising defense.

    improve the proportion of generated disguised responses. We observe that directly
    removing rejection sentences does not improve the results of RJ_GPT4 significantly.
    By analyzing the experimental samples, we found that GPT4 is more sensitive to
    the malicious attack question and has more replies containing rejection intent
    sentences compared to GPT3.5\. This leads to the fact that directly deleting the
    rejected sentences will invalidate the replies of GPT4, which in turn reduces
    the experimental effect. Therefore, we use prompt learning to induce the model

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser game framework to
    strengthen the ability of LLMs to disguise the defense intention and safely reply.
    In the multi-agent framework, intelligence plays different roles in performing
    dynamic adversarial interactions to simulate attack-defense scenarios. We design
    a multi-agent gaming algorithm so that the intelligent agent selects enhanced
    in-context learning samples based on the reward scores in each round. We use the
    curriculum training process to iteratively select disguised response samples from
    easy to difficult to strengthen the ability to disguise the defense intent. With
    our approach, the model can more effectively generate responses that are both
    secure and disguise the defense intent. Compared to other approaches, the model
    after adversarial gaming generates a higher percentage of samples with disguised
    replies. Meanwhile, the validation on other datasets likewise verifies the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach in enabling the model to use weak defense mechanisms
    in dealing with attacks.
